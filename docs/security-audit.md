# Security audit cursor

`security-audit` marks the inspected prefix of main's first-parent history. Only
repository admins may create or update it. Separate rulesets prohibit deleting it
or moving it backward, including for admins. GitHub cannot enforce membership in
main's history; the trusted Worker validates that relationship before each update.
Administrators must use that updater rather than directly pushing arbitrary commits.

The bootstrap is `8eecb48e9b51da99ca119f190a64ca43c100795b`, the main snapshot inspected
on 2026-10-12. That was a static source audit; earlier intermediate commits are
grandfathered, not individually audited. No identifiable malicious payload was found.
The benign D4 macro using `hygiene false` was subsequently removed and the cheap
source-option guard strengthened in #15202 and #15203.

TauCetiWorker's explicit `security-audit` phase examines only `TauCeti/` and
`TauCeti.lean` for IO and executable metaprogramming beyond macros and notation.
Macro bodies are inspected for these behaviors too. Scripts, workflows, Lake
configuration, dependency pins and other human-reviewed infrastructure are excluded.
Ordinary mathematical APIs and standard Mathlib tactics/registration commands are
allowed. This is not an additional mathematical review or a dependency/artifact audit.

Each session uses Luna or Haiku, with complete per-commit diffs and changed-file
contents, capped at 20 commits and 256 KiB. Individual commits are inspected in
order: a later revert cannot conceal an earlier dangerous version. Candidate code
is never executed. The model has no GitHub credential, shell or editing authority;
trusted Worker code verifies its structured verdict and updates the ref. A finding,
incomplete review or oversized commit stops the cursor for human attention. Local
input bundles, transcripts, verdicts and advancement records are retained by the worker.
After inspecting every intermediate commit themselves, an admin can use the Worker's
explicit `attest --through SHA --reason ...` command for an oversized range or to
resolve a finding. It records human evidence and repeats the same ancestry and
authority checks. A model re-roll is not a substitute for that review.

Local blocks are not a shared authorization service. Administrators must not evade
a finding by changing worker IDs, and should keep admin credentials out of ordinary
authoring/review agents. Recovering an accidental off-main admin push requires a
human to temporarily change the monotone ruleset, restore an inspected main commit,
and re-enable the protection.

## Toolchain tags

New `v*` tags are admin-only; existing tags cannot be changed or deleted. For a new
toolchain release, its commit must occur on main's first-parent history at or before
the cursor, and must meet the existing main CI and published-cache requirements.
`scripts/toolchain_tags.py --create` repeats the cursor check immediately before
publishing and records the cursor SHA in the annotated tag. Missing or invalid
cursor state blocks creation. Admins must use this tool; GitHub's tag restrictions
do not independently enforce cross-branch ancestry.

The readiness report runs when the toolchain changes or the cursor advances. It
reports releases ahead of the cursor as `pending-security-audit`. Historical tags,
including constructed side-branch releases, remain unchanged and show their historical
coverage. Constructing new side-branch release commits is no longer an exception.

This policy trusts repository admins and the installed Worker/tag tooling. A
malicious administrator can edit protections; an AI verdict can miss obfuscated code.
The cursor records a bounded source inspection, not a certification of safety.
