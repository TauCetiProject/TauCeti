/-- The two "lines of code by date" charts. The SVGs are regenerated at each site
deploy (and daily) into `static_files/` by the `pages` workflow, so this page never
needs touching as the project grows. They are embedded as a raw HTML blob: each
`<img>` simply points at the static asset. -/

merged PR advances (its `roadmap/<Area>` label). Regenerated at each deploy by the
`pages` workflow (`scripts/loc_roadmap_graph.py`), from the PR labels rather than git,
so it too needs no committed state. Embedded as a raw HTML blob pointing at the asset. -/

How much mathematics has Tau Ceti formalized, and how fast is the roadmap that
directs it growing? Each chart plots the total number of lines present at every
commit, counted straight from the git history and rebuilt from scratch at each
deploy, so the figures cannot drift.

The vertical scales differ by an order of magnitude and on purpose: the library is
measured in tens of thousands of lines of Lean, the roadmap in thousands of lines of
prose and target statements. The library figure counts only the mathematics — the
files under `TauCeti/` — not the website or tooling.

Which roadmap is all that Lean serving? Every pull request is labelled with the
roadmap it advances, so we can split the library by roadmap. The chart below stacks
the net lines each roadmap has accrued — every merged PR's additions minus its
deletions, attributed to its roadmap — by the day the PR merged. Because it sums
diffs rather than counting the lines in the tree, a line later rewritten counts under
both PRs, so this measures work landed per roadmap, not a snapshot line count.
Infrastructure and refactor PRs, which advance no roadmap, are left out.
