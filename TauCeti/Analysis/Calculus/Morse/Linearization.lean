# Linearization of the negative-gradient field at a Morse critical point

The stable-manifold theorem starts with the derivative of the vector field at an equilibrium. For
a gradient field on a real Hilbert space, the second derivative of the function naturally takes
values in the continuous dual. The Riesz equivalence turns it into an endomorphism of the original
space: `TauCeti.hessianOperator`.

At a twice continuously differentiable point this operator is self-adjoint, by symmetry of the
second derivative. At a nondegenerate critical point it is invertible, and the negative-gradient
field has derivative `-hessianOperator f x`. Consequently the field is its invertible linear part
up to a remainder of order `o(‖y - x‖)`. The characterization
`TauCeti.isNondegenerateCriticalPoint_iff_neg_gradient_linearization` packages exactly the
equilibrium and invertible-linearization hypotheses needed for the stable-manifold theorem in the
gradient setting.

The definition uses Mathlib's totalized Fréchet derivative, just as
`TauCeti.IsNondegenerateCriticalPoint` and `TauCeti.hessianQuadraticForm` do. Regularity enters the
results that identify the operator as the derivative of the gradient and prove self-adjointness.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.hessianOperator`: the Riesz-represented Hessian as an endomorphism of the Hilbert space.
* `TauCeti.hessianOperator_congr_of_eventuallyEq`: the operator depends only on the germ of the
  function at the point.
* `ContDiffAt.isSelfAdjoint_hessianOperator`: symmetry of the second derivative becomes
  self-adjointness of the Hessian operator.
* `ContDiffAt.hasFDerivAt_neg_gradient`: the derivative of `-∇ f` is the negative Hessian
  operator.
* `ContDiffAt.neg_gradient_sub_linearization_isLittleO`: at a `C²` critical point the nonlinear
  remainder after subtracting the linearization is little-o of the displacement.
* `TauCeti.isNondegenerateCriticalPoint_iff_neg_gradient_linearization`: nondegenerate critical
  points are exactly the equilibria with invertible negative-gradient linearization, under `C²`
  regularity.
