# Mean value estimates

## A directional mean value inequality

The mean value inequality only needs control of the derivative in the direction of the
chord being estimated, not an operator norm bound. This is useful on lower-dimensional
simplices, where derivatives are determined only on tangent directions, and when estimating
a parametrized map in terms of the size of its geometric chord.

The argument follows Mathlib's `Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasFDerivWithin_le`,
using its one-variable mean value inequality along the same line segment.

## Escaping a superlevel set at bounded speed

Let `w` be a differentiable real function on a real normed space whose derivative has norm at
most `L` on the band `{a ≤ w ≤ b}`. Starting from a point where `w ≥ b`, the function cannot reach
the level `a` within distance `(b - a) / L` (`TauCeti.lt_apply_add_of_norm_fderiv_le`).

Mathlib's `Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_fderiv_le` needs the derivative bound along the
whole segment; here it is only assumed on the band, which is what is available near a level set
of a function whose gradient is controlled only there. The proof applies the one-variable mean
value theorem on the part of the segment where the function crosses the band.

The file also records the one-variable form of Mathlib's
`Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasFDerivWithin_le'`, bounding the increment of a function
against a fixed derivative `φ` (`Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasDerivWithin_le'`).

## Comparing maps with nearby derivatives

If two maps on a convex set have derivatives within `ε` of a common linear map and agree at a
point `y`, then by the mean value inequality applied to their difference they stay within
`2 ε ‖x - y‖` of each other (`Convex.norm_sub_le_of_norm_hasFDerivWithin_sub_le`).
This compares a map to a model agreeing with it to first order before splicing them together
(`TauCeti.Analysis.Calculus.Splice`).

/-- **Two maps with nearby derivatives that agree at a point stay close.** If the derivatives of
`k` and `l` on a convex set `S` are within `ε` of a fixed linear map `A`, and `k` and `l` agree at
`y ∈ S`, then `‖l x - k x‖ ≤ 2 ε ‖x - y‖` for every `x ∈ S`. -/
