# A directional mean value inequality

The mean value inequality only needs control of the derivative in the direction of the
chord being estimated, not an operator norm bound. This is useful on lower-dimensional
simplices, where derivatives are determined only on tangent directions, and when estimating
a parametrized map in terms of the size of its geometric chord.

The argument follows Mathlib's `Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasFDerivWithin_le`,
using its one-variable mean value inequality along the same line segment.
