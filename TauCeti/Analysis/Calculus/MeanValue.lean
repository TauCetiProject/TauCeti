# Escaping a superlevel set at bounded speed

Let `w` be a differentiable real function on a real normed space whose derivative has norm at
most `L` on the band `{a ≤ w ≤ b}`. Starting from a point where `w ≥ b`, the function cannot reach
the level `a` within distance `(b - a) / L` (`TauCeti.lt_apply_add_of_norm_fderiv_le`).

Mathlib's `Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_fderiv_le` needs the derivative bound along the
whole segment; here it is only assumed on the band, which is what is available near a level set
of a function whose gradient is controlled only there. The proof applies the one-variable mean
value theorem on the part of the segment where the function crosses the band.
