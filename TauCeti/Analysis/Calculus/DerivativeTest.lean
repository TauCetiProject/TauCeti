# Necessary one-dimensional second-derivative tests

This file records necessary versions of Mathlib's sufficient second-derivative tests. At a local
maximum of a continuous real-valued function, the value `deriv (deriv g) t₀` is nonpositive; at a
local minimum it is nonnegative.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.deriv_deriv_nonpos_of_isLocalMax`: the local-maximum version.
* `TauCeti.deriv_deriv_nonneg_of_isLocalMin`: the local-minimum version.
