# The range of the derivative under restriction of scalars

For a map differentiable over a larger field `𝕜'`, the derivative over `𝕜` is the restriction of
scalars of the derivative over `𝕜'`, so the two derivatives have the same range. For a holomorphic
map, the real tangent space is the complex tangent space.

## Main result

* `DifferentiableAt.range_fderiv_restrictScalars`: the range of the derivative does not depend
  on the field of scalars.
