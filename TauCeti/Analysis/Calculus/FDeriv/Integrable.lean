# Integrability of the applied derivative of a compactly supported function

The derivative of a `C¹` function with compact support is continuous and compactly supported,
hence bounded. So along a strongly measurable family of points `G`, the derivative applied to an
integrable family of vectors `Z` is integrable: it is dominated by a constant times `‖Z‖`. No
finiteness of the measure is needed.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.integrable_fderiv_apply`: for `f` of class `C¹` with compact support, an a.e. strongly
  measurable `G` and an integrable `Z`, the map `x ↦ fderiv 𝕜 f (G x) (Z x)` is integrable.
