# The derivative of the inverse of an open partial homeomorphism

Mathlib's `OpenPartialHomeomorph.hasFDerivAt_symm` computes the derivative of the inverse from an
invertible derivative of the map. Without assuming that invertibility, this file records that when
both the map and its inverse are differentiable at corresponding points, their derivatives compose
to the identity.

## Main results

* `OpenPartialHomeomorph.fderiv_symm_comp_fderiv`: the derivative of the inverse is a left inverse
  of the derivative.
