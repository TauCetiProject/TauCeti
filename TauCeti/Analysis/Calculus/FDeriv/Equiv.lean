# Derivatives under local and linear equivalences

Mathlib's `OpenPartialHomeomorph.hasFDerivAt_symm` computes the derivative of the inverse from an
invertible derivative of the map. Without assuming that invertibility, this file records that when
both the map and its inverse are differentiable at corresponding points, their derivatives compose
to the identity.

## Main results

* `OpenPartialHomeomorph.fderiv_symm_comp_fderiv`: the derivative of the inverse is a left inverse
  of the derivative.

Precomposition by a continuous linear equivalence preserves the image of the vanishing-derivative
locus, with no differentiability premise. This follows the totalized derivative calculation in
[KLS](https://github.com/human-ai-mathematics/kls-lean), commit
`65810c73f9dd7945fc646ab484cb19d673f5291d`,
