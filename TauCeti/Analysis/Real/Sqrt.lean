# Rescaling by a square root

For `0 ≤ a`, multiplying by `(√a)⁻¹` and squaring divides the square by `a`:
`((√a)⁻¹ * x) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 / a`. This is the change of variables `x ↦ (√a)⁻¹ * x` that turns the
kernel `1 + x ^ 2 / a` into `1 + y ^ 2`. A square factor comes out of a square root as its
absolute value: `√(x ^ 2 * y) = |x| * √y`.

## Main results

* `Real.inv_sqrt_mul_sq`: `((√a)⁻¹ * x) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 / a` for `0 ≤ a`.
* `Real.sqrt_sq_mul`: `√(x ^ 2 * y) = |x| * √y`.
