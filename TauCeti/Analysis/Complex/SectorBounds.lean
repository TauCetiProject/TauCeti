# Norm bounds for nonnegative translations in complex sectors

For a complex number separated in argument from the negative real axis, adding a nonnegative
real number increases the norm at least linearly, with an explicit constant depending only on
the angular separation. These inequalities control reciprocal kernels in sectorial integrals.
