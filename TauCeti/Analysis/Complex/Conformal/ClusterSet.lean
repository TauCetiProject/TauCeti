# The boundary cluster set of a conformal map

The cluster set `TauCeti.clusterSetOn f U w` of a map `f` on `U` at a point `w`, and the criterion
`TauCeti.exists_continuousOn_closure_eqOn` turning subsingleton boundary cluster sets into a
continuous extension, use nothing about conformality and live in `TauCeti/Topology/ClusterSet.lean`:
the cluster set is defined over an arbitrary pair of topological spaces, and the criterion is a
compactness statement, holding for any map of a `T3` codomain taking its values in a compact set —
a bounded-image map into a proper metric space being the special case
`TauCeti.exists_continuousOn_closure_eqOn_of_isBounded`. This file adds what conformality
contributes.

`Conformal/BoundaryCorrespondence.lean` proves what a conformal map does *given* a continuous
extension to the closure. This file supplies the missing half of that interface: it removes the
extension from the hypotheses.

* **Unconditionally, the boundary cluster set of a conformal map lies on the frontier of the
  image.** This is the extension-free form of `TauCeti.notMem_image_of_mem_frontier`: no continuous
  extension is assumed, and the conclusion is about *every* cluster value. The mechanism is the
  properness of a conformal map, exactly as there — a cluster value inside the open set `f '' U`
  would be approached frequently inside a compact subset of `f '' U` that properness says `f`
  leaves eventually.
* **An extension injective on the frontier is injective on the closure.** This supplies the
  injectivity hypothesis of `TauCeti.closureHomeomorph`, reducing it to a condition on the boundary
  alone, because the boundary values have just been shown to avoid the image.
* **Conversely, the boundary cluster sets exhaust the frontier of the image**, for a bounded
  domain: no boundary point of `f '' U` is missed. This is the surjectivity of the boundary
  correspondence, and it is what makes the inclusion of the first item an equality.

A third ingredient is again not about conformality and is proved upstream, in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Convex/ClusterSet.lean`: on a **convex** domain — the unit disc, in the
Riemann-mapping application — the cluster set of a continuous map with bounded image is a
*continuum*, by `TauCeti.isConnected_clusterSetOn_of_convex_of_isBounded`. Combining it with the
first item above, the boundary cluster set of a conformal map of the disc onto a bounded region is
a nonempty compact connected subset of the frontier of the image, and Carathéodory's theorem is
exactly the assertion that this continuum degenerates to a point.

Together with the extension criterion these are the two halves of the vocabulary that layer **L5**
of the conformal-mapping roadmap — Carathéodory's boundary correspondence — is stated in.
Carathéodory's theorem asserts that for a Riemann map of a Jordan domain every boundary cluster set
is a singleton; feeding that into `TauCeti.exists_continuousOn_closure_eqOn` gives a continuous
extension to `closure U`, and upgrading it to a homeomorphism of closures needs one further input,
namely injectivity of the extension on `frontier U`, which `TauCeti.injOn_closure_of_injOn_frontier`
then propagates to `closure U` for `TauCeti.closureHomeomorph`. Neither the singleton property nor
boundary injectivity is proved here.

In accordance with the generality bar of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, which fixes scalar `ℂ` for
every theorem added in layers L0–L6, the results below are stated for maps of `ℂ`, as in
`Conformal/BoundaryCorrespondence.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.notMem_image_of_mem_clusterSetOn` and `TauCeti.clusterSetOn_subset_frontier_image` — a
  boundary cluster value of a conformal map lies on the frontier of the image.
* `TauCeti.injOn_closure_of_injOn_frontier` — an extension injective on the frontier is injective
  on the closure.
* `TauCeti.exists_mem_frontier_mem_clusterSetOn` and
  `TauCeti.biUnion_clusterSetOn_eq_frontier_image` — **the boundary correspondence is onto**: on a
  bounded domain the boundary cluster sets cover, hence exactly exhaust, the frontier of the image.
  The case a Riemann map presents is the unit disc, where `frontier_ball` rewrites `frontier U` to
  the unit circle.
* `TauCeti.exists_mem_frontier_inter_closure_mem_clusterSetOn` — surjectivity is moreover *local*
  in the domain: a boundary point of the image adherent to `f '' (U ∩ A)` is already a cluster
  value over `frontier U ∩ closure A`. The previous item is the case `A = univ`.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Layer L5 is absent from
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), the in-progress
human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which stops at the mapping theorem itself, and
Mathlib has no boundary correspondence for conformal maps. So this file is new Lean formalization
rather than a temporary shim. It consumes the L0–L3 shim
`TauCeti.isOpen_image_of_differentiableOn_of_injOn` through
`Conformal/BoundaryCorrespondence.lean`, to be refactored onto Mathlib once the upstream work
lands.

`f '' U` would be approached frequently inside a compact ball contained in `f '' U`, which

`f`, on `frontier U` it is injective by hypothesis, and a boundary value lies outside `f '' U` by
`TauCeti.notMem_image_of_mem_frontier`. This supplies the injectivity hypothesis of
`TauCeti.closureHomeomorph`, reducing it to a condition on the boundary alone. -/

/-! ## The boundary correspondence is onto -/

/-- **A boundary point of the image adherent to the image of a part of the domain is a cluster
value on the part of the frontier that part clings to.** If `f` is holomorphic and injective on a
bounded open `U` and a point `v` of `frontier (f '' U)` is adherent to `f '' (U ∩ A)`, then `v` is
already approached by `f` at a point of `frontier U ∩ closure A`.

All the work is done by the general covering theorem
`TauCeti.exists_mem_frontier_mem_clusterSetOn_of_notMem_image`, applied to `U ∩ A` rather than to
`U`: it needs only that `closure (U ∩ A)` be compact — here, boundedness of `U` — and that `f` be
continuous there. What conformality contributes is that `f '' U` is *open*, so that
`frontier (f '' U)` is `closure (f '' U) \ f '' U` and the boundary value `v` is an adherent value
of the image that is not attained, a fortiori not attained on `U ∩ A`.

The witness it returns lies on `frontier (U ∩ A) ⊆ closure U ∩ closure A`, and enlarging the
approach region from `U ∩ A` back to `U` keeps `v` a cluster value. That the witness is on
`frontier U` and not interior to `U` is the same argument once more: at an interior point the
cluster set of `f` on `U` is the single value `f w`, which `v` is not, the image being open. -/

/-- **Every boundary point of the image is a boundary cluster value.** If `f` is holomorphic and
injective on a bounded open `U`, then each point of `frontier (f '' U)` is approached by `f` at some
point of `frontier U`.

This is the case `A = univ` of
`TauCeti.exists_mem_frontier_inter_closure_mem_clusterSetOn`, every point of `frontier (f '' U)`
being adherent to the image.

This is the converse of `TauCeti.clusterSetOn_subset_frontier_image`, and the two together say that
the boundary correspondence `w ↦ clusterSetOn f U w` is onto `frontier (f '' U)`. Carathéodory's
theorem — layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping roadmap — refines this for a Riemann map of a Jordan
domain by showing each of these cluster sets to be a singleton, which turns the correspondence into
a continuous *map* of `frontier U` onto `frontier (f '' U)`; that this map is moreover *injective*
is a further assertion of Carathéodory's theorem, and does not follow from the singleton property.
The surjectivity below holds with no hypothesis on `frontier U` whatever. -/

  exact ⟨w, hw.1, hvw⟩

/-- **The boundary cluster sets exhaust the frontier of the image.** For a conformal map of a
bounded open set, the union of the cluster sets over `frontier U` is exactly `frontier (f '' U)`.

One inclusion is `TauCeti.clusterSetOn_subset_frontier_image` — no boundary cluster value is
attained, and none escapes the closure of the image — and the other is
`TauCeti.exists_mem_frontier_mem_clusterSetOn`. Neither connectedness nor simple connectedness of
`U` is used, and nothing is assumed about `frontier U`. -/
