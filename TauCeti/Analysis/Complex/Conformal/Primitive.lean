# Primitives on a simply connected domain, and Cauchy's theorem there

A holomorphic function on a simply connected open subset of `ℂ` has a primitive. Mathlib proves
this on a disc (`DifferentiableOn.isExactOn_ball`) and on the whole plane
(`Differentiable.isExactOn_univ`), and records the simply connected case as an open `TODO` in
`Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/HasPrimitives.lean`. This file discharges that case by transporting the
disc statement along a Riemann map, and then reads off the forms of Cauchy's theorem that primitive
existence gives for free: the integral of a holomorphic function along a *loop* in a simply
connected domain vanishes, and so does its integral along any circle whose *circle* — not its
closed disc — lies in the domain.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DifferentiableOn.isExactOn_of_isSimplyConnected` — a holomorphic function on a simply
  connected open set has a primitive there, in Mathlib's `Complex.IsExactOn` vocabulary.
* `TauCeti.isExactOn_iff_differentiableOn_of_isSimplyConnected` — on a simply connected open set,
  having a primitive and being holomorphic are the same condition.
* `TauCeti.cauchyTheorem_of_isSimplyConnected` — **Cauchy's theorem for a simply connected
  domain**: `∫ t in a..b, γ' t • f (γ t) = 0` for a differentiable loop `γ` in the domain.
* `TauCeti.circleIntegral_eq_zero_of_isSimplyConnected` — `∮ z in C(c, R), f z = 0` as soon as the
  circle `Metric.sphere c |R|` is contained in the domain.

## Proof

Write `Ω` for the domain. If `Ω = Set.univ` the statement is Mathlib's
`Differentiable.isExactOn_univ`. Otherwise `Ω` is a nonempty, simply connected, *proper* open
subset of `ℂ`, so the Riemann mapping theorem
(`TauCeti.exists_bijOn_ball_differentiableOn_invFunOn`) supplies a biholomorphism `φ : Ω → 𝔻` with
holomorphic inverse `ψ = Function.invFunOn φ Ω`. The pullback `w ↦ ψ' w • f (ψ w)` is holomorphic
on the disc, hence has a primitive `H` there by `DifferentiableOn.isExactOn_ball`, and `H ∘ φ` is a
primitive of `f` on `Ω`: the chain rule contributes the factor `φ' z * ψ' (φ z)`, which is `1`
because `ψ ∘ φ` is the identity near `z`.

This is the standard "uniformisation" proof, and it is why the result belongs to the conformal
layer rather than to the contour-integration layer below it: the only nonformal input is the
Riemann mapping theorem itself.

## Generality

Statements are scalar, `f : ℂ → ℂ`. Mathlib's `Complex.IsExactOn` API is stated for a function
valued in a complete normed `ℂ`-space and the proof below goes through verbatim at that
generality, but the `ConformalMapping` roadmap fixes a generality bar for everything its layers
add — "every theorem this entry *adds*, from L0 … through L6, is scalar `ℂ`" — while allowing
`E`-valued Mathlib results to be *consumed*. If a Banach-valued consumer ever appears, the
`E`-valued statement is a one-line generalisation of this file.

## Relation to the null-homotopic Cauchy theorem

`TauCeti.Contour.cauchyTheorem_of_pathHomotopy_refl` proves Cauchy's theorem for a loop in an
*arbitrary* open set that comes equipped with a `C²` path homotopy to a constant. Neither statement
subsumes the other: that one does not ask the ambient set to be simply connected, while
`cauchyTheorem_of_isSimplyConnected` asks for no homotopy witness and no regularity beyond
differentiability of the loop, which is what makes it usable for a loop handed over with no
homotopy in sight.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

The Riemann mapping theorem consumed here is Tau Ceti's L3 statement, an explicitly temporary shim
for the human-curated proof in progress at
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505); see
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/RiemannMapping/Existence.lean`. When that lands, this file
should be refactored onto the Mathlib theorem — and its main result offered upstream, where it
answers the `TODO` in `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/HasPrimitives.lean`.

This is the simply connected case of Mathlib's `Complex.IsExactOn` theory, recorded there as a
`TODO`: `DifferentiableOn.isExactOn_ball` covers a disc and `Differentiable.isExactOn_univ` covers
the plane. The proof transports the disc case along a Riemann map, so the plane has to be split off
first — it is the one simply connected open set the Riemann mapping theorem excludes. -/

The forward implication is Mathlib's `Complex.IsExactOn.differentiableOn`, which holds on any open
set; simple connectivity is exactly what makes the converse true. -/

/-- **Cauchy's theorem for a simply connected domain.** The integral of a holomorphic function
along a loop contained in a simply connected open set vanishes.

The loop is described by its own derivative `γ'`, as in Mathlib's
`intervalIntegral.integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt`; no regularity beyond differentiability of `γ`
and integrability of the integrand is required, and in particular no homotopy witness. Compare
`TauCeti.Contour.cauchyTheorem_of_pathHomotopy_refl`, which drops simple connectivity of the
ambient set but asks for a `C²` null-homotopy of the loop instead. -/

`Metric.sphere c |R|` lies in a simply connected open set on which `f` is holomorphic, then
`∮ z in C(c, R), f z = 0`.

Only the circle, not the closed disc it bounds, is asked to lie in the domain: that is what simple
connectivity buys over Mathlib's
`Complex.circleIntegral_eq_zero_of_differentiable_on_off_countable`, which needs
`Metric.closedBall c R` inside the domain. -/
