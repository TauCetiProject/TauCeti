# Conjugation-invariant discs

Complex conjugation is an isometry fixing the real axis (Mathlib's `Complex.dist_conj_conj`), so
it maps every open or closed disc centred on the real axis to itself. Such discs are the natural
domains for reflection across the real axis, for instance the even reflection
`TauCeti.evenReflection`.
