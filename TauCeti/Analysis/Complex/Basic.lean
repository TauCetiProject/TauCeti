# Complex conjugation: invariant discs and a symmetric norm

Complex conjugation is an isometry fixing the real axis (Mathlib's `Complex.dist_conj_conj`), so
it maps every open or closed disc centred on the real axis to itself. Such discs are the natural
domains for reflection across the real axis, for instance the even reflection
`TauCeti.evenReflection`.

Conjugation also preserves norms (Mathlib's `Complex.norm_conj`), so the norm of
`1 - conj w * z` is symmetric in `z` and `w` (`Complex.norm_one_sub_conj_mul_comm`). This
expression is the denominator of the Möbius automorphisms of the unit disc and of the
pseudo-hyperbolic expression.
