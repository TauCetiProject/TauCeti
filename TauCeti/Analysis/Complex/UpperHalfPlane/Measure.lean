# The invariant measure on `ℍ` and the Lebesgue measure on `ℂ`

Comparison of Mathlib's invariant measure `volume : Measure ℍ` (`dx dy / y²`) with the
pullback of the Lebesgue measure along the embedding `ℍ ↪ ℂ`: the two are mutually
absolutely continuous, since the density `(Im τ)⁻²` is everywhere positive. Consequently
the invariant measure is positive on nonempty open sets, and preimages of Lebesgue-null
subsets of `ℂ` are null in `ℍ`.

## Main results

* `UpperHalfPlane.volume_absolutelyContinuous_comap`,
  `UpperHalfPlane.comap_absolutelyContinuous_volume`: mutual absolute continuity.
* the `IsOpenPosMeasure` instance for `volume : Measure ℍ`.
* `UpperHalfPlane.volume_preimage_coe_null`: preimages of Lebesgue-null sets are null.
* the `NullSingletonClass` instance for `volume : Measure ℍ`: points, hence countable sets, are
  null.
