# Closed range from a finite-dimensional cokernel

For the nonlinear-analysis substrate of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap (Lane F0, "Fredholm
operators and index theory"), this file proves that the closed-range hypothesis in the definition
of a Fredholm operator is *automatic* between Banach spaces once the cokernel is finite
dimensional.

Concretely, a continuous linear map `T : E →L[𝕜] F` between complete normed spaces whose cokernel
`F ⧸ range T` is finite dimensional already has closed range. The proof is a clean application of
the Banach open mapping theorem: choosing a finite-dimensional algebraic complement `N` of
`range T`, the auxiliary map `Φ(x, n) = T x + n` from `E × N` is a continuous linear surjection
between Banach spaces, hence a quotient map, and `range T = Φ '' (E × {0})` is the image of the
closed set `Φ ⁻¹' range T`, so it is closed.

This upgrades the Fredholm predicate of `TauCeti.Analysis.Fredholm.Basic`: over Banach spaces a
Fredholm operator is *exactly* a continuous linear map with finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel,
the closed-range condition following for free. Downstream this lets Sard–Smale and transversality
arguments certify Fredholmness of a linearization from the two defect spaces alone, without a
separate closed-range check.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.isClosed_range_of_finiteDimensional_coker`: a continuous linear map
  between Banach spaces with finite-dimensional cokernel has closed range.
* `TauCeti.IsFredholm.of_finiteDimensional_ker_coker`: over Banach spaces, finite-dimensional
  kernel and cokernel suffice for Fredholmness.
* `TauCeti.isFredholm_iff_finiteDimensional_ker_coker`: over Banach spaces, the Fredholm predicate
  is equivalent to finite dimensionality of the kernel and cokernel.

The conventions follow McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix
A.1, where a Fredholm operator has finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel; the closed-range
condition is noted there to be automatic between Banach spaces.

/-- A continuous linear map between Banach spaces whose cokernel `F ⧸ range T` is finite
dimensional has closed range.

Closedness of the range is therefore not an independent hypothesis in the Banach setting: it is
forced by finite dimensionality of the cokernel. The proof runs the Banach open mapping theorem on
the surjection `Φ(x, n) = T x + n` from `E × N`, where `N` is a finite-dimensional algebraic
complement of `range T`. -/
