# Injective and surjective criteria for Fredholm operators

This file gives streamlined Fredholm criteria when an operator is already known to be injective
or surjective. A surjective continuous linear map is Fredholm exactly when its kernel is finite
dimensional. Dually, an injective continuous linear map with closed range is Fredholm exactly when
its cokernel is finite dimensional. The Fredholm index then reduces to the dimension of the one
remaining defect space.

These criteria are the elementary endpoints of the finite-dimensional reductions used throughout
Fredholm theory. In particular, a surjective linearization in a transversality argument has index
equal to the dimension of its kernel.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.isFredholm_iff_finiteDimensional_ker_of_surjective`: the surjective criterion.
* `TauCeti.isFredholm_iff_finiteDimensional_coker_of_injective`: the injective closed-range
  criterion.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.index_eq_finrank_ker_of_surjective`: the index of a surjective
  Fredholm operator.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousLinearMap.index_eq_neg_finrank_coker_of_injective`: the index of an injective
  Fredholm operator.

The conventions follow McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix
A.1.
