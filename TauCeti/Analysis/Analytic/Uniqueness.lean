# Analytic functions are determined by their restrictions to lines

A function analytic at `p` vanishes on a neighbourhood of `p` exactly when its restriction
`t ↦ f (p + t • v)` to every line through `p` vanishes on a neighbourhood of `0`. The nontrivial
direction is the identity principle along each line: on a ball around `p` where `f` is analytic,
the restriction to the line through `p` and a point `y` of the ball is analytic on a disc
containing `0` and `1`, so it vanishes at `1`, that is at `y`.

In several complex variables this is the first step of putting a nonzero germ in general position:
some direction `v` has a restriction that does not vanish identically, and in linear coordinates
whose last axis is `v` the germ becomes regular in the last variable, as Weierstrass preparation
requires (`AnalyticAt.exists_continuousLinearEquiv_analyticOrderAt_ne_top`).

The name follows Mathlib's `Mathlib.Analysis.Analytic.Uniqueness`, where the identity principle
lives.

## Main declarations

* `AnalyticAt.eventuallyEq_zero_iff_forall_eventuallyEq_zero_comp_add_smul`: an analytic function
  vanishes near `p` exactly when all its restrictions to lines through `p` vanish near `0`.
* `AnalyticAt.exists_continuousLinearEquiv_analyticOrderAt_ne_top`: after a linear change of
  coordinates, a function on `E × 𝕜` not vanishing near `p` has finite order in the last variable.

/-- **General position in the last variable.** A function analytic at `p` on `E × 𝕜` that does not
vanish near `p` becomes regular in the last variable after a linear change of coordinates: there
are a continuous linear automorphism `L` and a point `q` with `L q = p` such that
`t ↦ f (L (q.1, t))` has finite analytic order at `q.2`. The last axis is sent to a direction along
which the restriction of `f` does not vanish identically. -/
