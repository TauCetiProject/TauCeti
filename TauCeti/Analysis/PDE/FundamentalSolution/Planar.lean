# The planar Newtonian kernel away from its pole

This file introduces the logarithmic kernel for the negative Laplacian on the complex plane,

`G(z) = -(2 * π)⁻¹ * log ‖z‖`,

and establishes its classical pointwise properties away from the pole.  In particular, `G` and
each translate `z ↦ G (z - a)` are harmonic away from their poles.  The distributional identity
`-Δ G = δ₀`, which fixes the normalization by computing the flux through a circle, is deliberately
left to the later distributional development of the fundamental solution.

The harmonicity proof consumes Mathlib's `AnalyticAt.harmonicAt_log_norm`, applied to the identity
or to `z ↦ z - a`.  The remaining results record the translation, symmetry, and scaling API used
when the kernel is integrated against a source to form a Newtonian potential.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.planarNewtonianKernel`: the logarithmic kernel for `-Δ` on `ℂ`.
* `TauCeti.harmonicAt_planarNewtonianKernel`: harmonicity away from the origin.
* `TauCeti.harmonicAt_planarNewtonianKernel_sub`: harmonicity of a kernel with pole `a`.
* `TauCeti.laplacian_planarNewtonianKernel`: the pointwise equation `Δ G = 0` off the pole.

/-- The Newtonian kernel for the negative Laplacian on the plane, represented as `ℂ`.

The value assigned at the pole is immaterial for the pointwise theory in this file.  Lean's
convention `Real.log 0 = 0` makes this a total function; analytically, the kernel has a logarithmic
singularity there. -/
