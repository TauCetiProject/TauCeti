# Polars of absolutely convex hulls

The absolute polar for a bilinear pairing is unchanged by taking an absolutely
convex hull. For the continuous dual pairing, taking the closed absolutely convex
hull also leaves the polar unchanged. This second identity holds for any module
carrying a topology, with no continuity assumed for addition or scalar
multiplication. These identities let separation arguments pass between a
generating set and its closed disked hull.
