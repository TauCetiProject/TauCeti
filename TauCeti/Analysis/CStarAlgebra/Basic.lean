# Compactness of unitary groups of C⋆-rings

In a C⋆-ring every unitary element has norm at most one (`CStarRing.norm_coe_unitary`), and the
unitary elements form a closed set. So when the closed balls of the ring are compact, as for a
finite-dimensional C⋆-algebra such as the operators on a finite-dimensional inner product space,
its unitary group is compact. In particular the orthogonal and unitary groups of a
finite-dimensional real or complex inner product space are compact.

## Main results

* `CStarRing.isCompact_unitary`: the unitary elements of a proper C⋆-ring form a compact set.
* `CStarRing.instCompactSpaceUnitary`: the unitary group of a proper C⋆-ring is compact.
