# Characters from unitary multipliers

A unitary representation need not be continuous in the norm of a C⋆-algebra. Nevertheless,
a character of a subalgebra detects a continuous circle-valued character whenever it is nonzero
on an operator whose translates are norm continuous and belong to the subalgebra. The resulting
character describes every translate that belongs to the subalgebra, so it is independent of
the operator used to detect it.

This is the character-identification step in the spectral representation of a strongly
continuous unitary representation, applied to a nonzero integrated operator.

/-- A character nonzero on a commuting operator with norm-continuous unitary translates
induces a unique continuous circle-valued character. It describes every translate in the subalgebra,
not just the translates of the witnessing operator. -/
