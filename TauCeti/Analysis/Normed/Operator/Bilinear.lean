# Pulling back continuous bilinear maps

A continuous linear map `u : W →L[𝕜] V` pulls a continuous bilinear map `B` on `V` back to the
bilinear map `B (u ·) (u ·)` on `W`. This operation is itself continuous and linear in `B`
(`ContinuousLinearMap.pullbackBilinL`), so that it commutes with derivatives of families of
bilinear maps, such as the coordinate expressions of metrics. In particular, pulling back each
value of a continuous family of multilinear maps valued in bilinear maps, along `u` in every
argument, gives a continuous family
(`Continuous.pullbackBilinL_compContinuousMultilinearMap`). Pulling back along a bijection preserves
nondegeneracy (`ContinuousLinearMap.injective_bilinearComp`).

its regularity in `u` follows from that of the precomposition maps `compL`. -/

maps, both in its arguments and in its values, along a continuous linear map `u` gives a
continuous family. Applied to iterated derivatives of a family of bilinear forms, this is the
pullback of all their coordinate derivatives along `u`. -/
