# The rank of a continuous family of projections

Let `p : B → F →L[𝕜] F` be a continuous family of idempotent operators on a Banach space `F`.
Near any `x₀`, the operator `p x * p x₀ + (1 - p x) * (1 - p x₀)` is invertible, since it equals
`1` at `x₀` and the units of `F →L[𝕜] F` form an open set. It then carries the range of `p x₀`
isomorphically onto the range of `p x` (`ContinuousLinearMap.IsIdempotentElem.rangeEquiv`), so
the ranges of nearby projections are isomorphic and the rank of the family is locally constant.
No compactness, separation or finite-dimensionality is assumed of the base or the fibres.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isOpen_setOf_isUnit_intertwiner`: the intertwining operator of a continuous family is
  invertible on an open set, and `TauCeti.continuousOn_inverse_intertwiner`: its inverse is
  continuous there.
* `TauCeti.eventually_nonempty_continuousLinearEquiv_range`: the ranges of nearby projections in
  a continuous family are isomorphic.
* `TauCeti.isLocallyConstant_finrank_range`: the rank of a continuous family of projections is
  locally constant.
