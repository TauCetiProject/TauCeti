# Operator norms of bounded maps extended to completions

A bounded semilinear map `f : E →SL[σ₁₂] F` between seminormed spaces extends to the bounded
map `f.completion` between the completions, and, when `F` is complete and Hausdorff, to the
bounded map `f.fromCompletion` from the completion of `E` to `F`. Since `E` has dense image in
its completion and the canonical map preserves norms, neither extension changes the operator norm.

These are the continuous semilinear analogues of Mathlib's `NormedAddGroupHom.norm_completion`.
They make extension to completions an isometric operation, as needed for the norm-preserving
universal properties of completed normed constructions.

## Main results

* `ContinuousLinearMap.norm_completion`: `‖f.completion‖ = ‖f‖`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.norm_fromCompletion`: `‖f.fromCompletion‖ = ‖f‖`.
