# Basic facts about seminormed groups

In a seminormed additive group, the squared distance between two points is at most twice the sum
of their squared distances to any third point: the triangle inequality through `c`, squared with
`(x + y) ^ 2 ≤ 2 (x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)`.

An unbounded set stays unbounded after removing a closed ball, since a closed ball is bounded.

A bound on the norms of a set with two distinct points is positive, since one of the points is
nonzero.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.norm_sub_sq_le_two_mul` -- the squared triangle inequality through an intermediate
  point.
* `TauCeti.not_isBounded_inter_lt_norm_sub` -- the part of an unbounded set outside a closed ball
  is unbounded.
* `Set.Nontrivial.pos_of_forall_norm_le` -- a bound on the norms of a nontrivial set is positive.
