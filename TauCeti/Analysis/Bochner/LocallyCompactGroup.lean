# Bochner's theorem on locally compact abelian groups

A positive-definite function `φ` on a locally compact abelian group `G` that is continuous at `0`
is the Fourier–Stieltjes transform `φ(g) = ∫ χ(g) dμ(χ)` of a finite inner regular positive
measure `μ` on the Pontryagin dual of `G`.

The representing measure is unique among finite inner regular measures, and conversely the
transform of every such measure is continuous and positive definite. Thus this is a full Bochner
characterization without any countability assumption. When the dual is Polish, every finite Borel
measure is regular, giving the corresponding characterization by arbitrary finite measures. The
dual is Polish when `G` is second countable.

The measure comes from the GNS construction. The function `φ` is a matrix coefficient
`φ(g) = ⟪v, U(-g) v⟫` of the unitary translation representation `U` on its GNS Hilbert space,
which is strongly continuous because `φ` is continuous at `0`. The cyclic spectral theorem for
strongly continuous unitary representations,
`ContRepresentation.exists_pontryaginMeasureTransform_eq_inner`, writes such a matrix coefficient
as a Fourier–Stieltjes transform.

The existence theorem assumes no second countability of `G`, and the GNS space need not be
separable: the integrated form behind the spectral theorem is defined through the inner
regularity of the Haar measure.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefiniteSub.exists_pontryaginMeasureTransform_eq_of_continuousAt`: a
  positive-definite function, continuous at `0`, on a locally compact abelian group is the
  Fourier–Stieltjes transform of a finite inner regular measure on the dual group.
* The countability-free Bochner characterization: continuous positive-definite functions are
  precisely the transforms of unique finite inner regular measures.
* `TauCeti.continuous_and_isPositiveDefiniteSub_iff_existsUnique_pontryaginMeasureTransform_eq`:
  the full Bochner characterization by unique finite measures on a locally compact abelian
  group with Polish dual.
