# The Gaussian is a positive-definite function

The Gaussian `a ↦ exp (-c‖a‖²)` on a finite-dimensional real inner-product space `V` is
continuous and positive definite for every `c ≥ 0`. This supplies the positive-definiteness
half of the Gaussian acceptance example requested in Part C of the `OneParameterSemigroups`
roadmap in TauCetiRoadmap ("positive-definite functions and Bochner's theorem"); the
representing-measure half is a later Bochner-representation milestone.

The positive-definiteness is not proved from scratch: Mathlib's
`ProbabilityTheory.charFun_stdGaussian` computes the characteristic function of the standard
Gaussian measure on `V` to be `t ↦ exp (-‖t‖²/2)`, and
`TauCeti.charFun_isPositiveDefinite_of_star_eq_neg` (the finite-measure Fourier-transform
correspondence) already records that a characteristic function is positive definite for the
negation involution `a⋆ = -a`. Rescaling the argument by `√(2c)` turns `exp (-‖·‖²/2)` into
`exp (-c‖·‖²)`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.charFun_stdGaussian_sqrt_smul`: `charFun (stdGaussian V) (√(2c) • a) = exp (-c‖a‖²)`.
* `TauCeti.isPositiveDefinite_cexp_neg_mul_sq_norm`: `a ↦ exp (-c‖a‖²)` is positive definite for
  `c ≥ 0` under the negation involution.
* `TauCeti.isPositiveDefiniteKernel_cexp_neg_mul_sq_norm`: the involution-free kernel form,
  `(a, b) ↦ exp (-c‖a - b‖²)` is a positive-definite kernel.
* `TauCeti.continuous_cexp_neg_mul_sq_norm`: `a ↦ exp (-c‖a‖²)` is continuous.
* `TauCeti.isPositiveDefinite_cexp_neg_sq_norm`: the `c = 1` acceptance example
  `a ↦ exp (-‖a‖²)`.
