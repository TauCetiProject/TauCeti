# Bochner's theorem on discrete abelian groups

A function `φ` on a discrete abelian group `G` is positive definite,
`∑ᵢ ∑ⱼ cᵢ conj(cⱼ) φ(gᵢ - gⱼ) ≥ 0` for every finite family, if and only if it is the
Fourier–Stieltjes transform `φ(g) = ∫ χ(g) dμ(χ)` of a finite positive measure `μ` on the
Pontryagin dual of `G`. Every function on a discrete group is continuous, so no continuity
hypothesis appears.

The representing measure is the one of Bochner's theorem on locally compact abelian groups,
`TauCeti.IsPositiveDefiniteSub.exists_pontryaginMeasureTransform_eq_of_continuousAt`, whose
continuity hypothesis is automatic on a discrete group.

For `G = ℤ` this recovers Herglotz's theorem, proved separately by Fejér means in
`TauCeti.Analysis.Bochner.Herglotz`.
