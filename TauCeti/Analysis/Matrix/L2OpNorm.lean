# The `ℓ²` operator norm as a normed real algebra

Mathlib's scoped `ℓ²` operator norm (`Matrix.Norms.L2Operator`) makes `Matrix n n 𝕜` a normed
`𝕜`-algebra, for `𝕜 = ℝ` or `ℂ` (any `RCLike` field). Results about continuous functional
calculi and the exponential stated over `ℝ` additionally need a normed `ℝ`-algebra structure on
`Matrix n n 𝕜`. This file provides it, extending the existing `ℝ`-algebra structure on matrices
rather than restricting scalars, so that no algebra diamond arises.

## Main definitions

* `Matrix.l2OpNormedAlgebraReal`: `Matrix n n 𝕜` with the `ℓ²` operator norm, as a normed
  `ℝ`-algebra.
