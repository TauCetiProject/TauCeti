# Topologies from matrix norms

This file exposes the topology underlying Mathlib's `L∞` operator norm on finite matrices. Since
matrix norms are scoped, consumers can select this topology locally without reconstructing the
instance projection chain.

Mathlib's `ContinuousStar` instance for matrices is stated for the entrywise topology. The `L∞`
operator topology agrees with it definitionally (`Matrix.linftyOpTopologicalSpace_eq`), but it is
not syntactically the same instance, so continuity of the conjugate transpose is transported along
that equality to the topology selected here.

## Main declarations

* `Matrix.linftyOpTopologicalSpace`: the topology induced by the `L∞` operator norm.
* `Matrix.linftyOpTopologicalSpace_eq`: that topology is the entrywise topology on matrices.
* `Matrix.linftyOpContinuousStar`: conjugate transposition is continuous for that topology.

/-- The topology of the `L∞` operator norm is the entrywise topology on matrices.

This holds by `rfl` by design of Mathlib's `PiLp.pseudoMetricSpaceToPi`, which underlies
`Matrix.linftyOpSeminormedAddCommGroup`: it pulls back the `L^p` distance along `WithLp.toLp`
and then replaces the uniformity by the product uniformity, so the induced topology is the
product topology, which is Mathlib's topology on matrices. -/
