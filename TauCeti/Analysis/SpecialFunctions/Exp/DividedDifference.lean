# Positive divided differences of the real exponential

The divided difference of the exponential is the integral of the exponential along the segment
between its arguments. In particular it is strictly positive, including when the arguments
coincide. It is jointly real analytic, including on the diagonal. These divided differences
are the scalar coefficients in the derivative of the matrix exponential at a Hermitian matrix.
