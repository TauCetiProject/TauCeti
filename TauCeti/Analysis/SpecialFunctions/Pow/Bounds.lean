# Elementary bounds on real powers with a negative exponent

A base at least `2` raised to a negative exponent of size at least `1` is at most `1 / 2`. This
is the shape in which the local ratio of an Euler factor is bounded away from `1`, so that the
denominator `1 - y ^ (-s)` stays bounded below.

## Main results

* `Real.rpow_neg_le_half`: `y ^ (-s) ≤ 1 / 2` for `2 ≤ y` and `1 ≤ s`.
