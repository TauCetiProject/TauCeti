# Differentiability of a function composed with the logarithm

For `x ≠ 0`, a function `v ∘ log` is differentiable at `x` exactly when `v` is differentiable at
`log x`, by evenness of `v ∘ log` for `x < 0`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.differentiableAt_comp_log_iff`: differentiability of `v ∘ log` at `x ≠ 0` is
  differentiability of `v` at `log x`.

For `x < 0` this uses that `v ∘ log` is even. -/
