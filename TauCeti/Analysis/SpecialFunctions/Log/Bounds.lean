# Elementary numerical bounds on the real logarithm

From `log x ≤ x - 1` for `x > 0` (`Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos`) applied at `x = 2` and `x / 2`,
one obtains `log 4 = 2 log 2 ≤ 2` and `log x / x ≤ 1 / 2` for every real `x ≥ 0` (holding at
`x = 0` via `0 / 0 = 0`). The first compares explicit prime-counting constants involving `log 4`
with rational constants, and the second bounds the contribution `log p / p` of a single prime at a
real cutoff `x` when passing between inclusive and strict prime sums.

## Main results

* `Real.log_four_le_two`: `log 4 ≤ 2`.
* `Real.log_div_self_le_half`: `log x / x ≤ 1 / 2` for every nonnegative real `x`.
