# The inverse logarithm and the iterated logarithm near the origin

This file complements Mathlib's `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.InvLog`, which records the
discontinuities of `x ↦ (log x)⁻¹` at `±1`, with its behaviour at the origin, and bounds the
iterated logarithm `log log (1 / x)` near the origin:

* `Real.continuousAt_inv_log_zero`: `(log x)⁻¹ → 0` as `x → 0`, so with Mathlib's conventions
  `log 0 = 0` and `0⁻¹ = 0` the function `x ↦ (log x)⁻¹` is continuous at the origin;
* `Real.abs_log_log_inv_le`: for `0 ≤ x < e⁻¹`, `|log log (1 / x)| ≤ log (1 / x)`.
