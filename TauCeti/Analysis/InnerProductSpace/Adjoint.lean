# Adjoints of isometric isomorphisms, of `L²` coordinate projections, norm bounds, and `1 + T`

Two families of adjoints of linear maps between finite-dimensional inner product spaces:

* the adjoint of an isometric isomorphism `e : E ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] F`, viewed as a linear map, is its
  inverse (`LinearIsometryEquiv.adjoint_coe_eq_symm`). This is Mathlib's
  `LinearIsometryEquiv.adjoint_toLinearMap_eq_symm`, stated for the coercion
  `(e : E →ₗ[𝕜] F)` in which compositions with isometric isomorphisms are usually written;
* on the `L²` product `WithLp 2 (E × F)`, the coordinate projections `WithLp.fstₗ` and
  `WithLp.sndₗ` are adjoint to the inclusions `x ↦ (x, 0)` and `y ↦ (0, y)` of the two factors.

Finally, a pointwise bound `‖C x‖ ≤ c * ‖x‖` passes to the adjoint
(`LinearMap.norm_adjoint_apply_le`). This is the operator-norm bound `‖C†‖ ≤ ‖C‖` in pointwise
form for algebraic linear maps, deduced from Mathlib's isometry `ContinuousLinearMap.adjoint`.

For a positive operator `T` on a possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, `1 + T` is
invertible (`ContinuousLinearMap.IsPositive.isUnit_one_add`), because
`re ⟪(1 + T) x, x⟫ ≥ ‖x‖²` bounds it below. This applies in particular to `T = X†X`.

/-- The adjoint of an isometric isomorphism, viewed as a linear map, is its inverse.

Mathlib's `LinearIsometryEquiv.adjoint_toLinearMap_eq_symm` states this for `e.toLinearMap`. The
coercion `(e : E →ₗ[𝕜] F)` instead factors through `e.toContinuousLinearEquiv`, so neither `rw`
nor `simp` can apply that lemma to it. -/
