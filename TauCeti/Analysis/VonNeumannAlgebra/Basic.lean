# Concrete von Neumann algebras as C⋆-algebras

A concrete von Neumann algebra is norm closed, since it is a double commutant.
Its elements therefore form a C⋆-algebra with the inherited operator norm and adjoint.
This allows the abstract continuous functional calculus and positive-functional APIs to
be applied directly to concrete algebras, including those acting on the zero Hilbert space.

The instances use Mathlib's generic subobject constructions, in particular
`StarSubalgebra.cstarAlgebra`. The underlying star subalgebra has the same instances;
no new norm, completion, or algebra carrier is introduced.
