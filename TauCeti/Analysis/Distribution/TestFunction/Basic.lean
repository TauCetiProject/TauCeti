# Components of vector-valued test functions in a basis

Let `F` be a finite-dimensional real normed space with a basis `(bᵢ)`. An `F`-valued test
function `φ` has the real-valued components `bᵢ* ∘ φ`, obtained by postcomposition with the
coordinate functionals of the basis, and is recovered from them as `φ = ∑ᵢ (bᵢ* ∘ φ) • bᵢ`.
Conversely, for a real test function `ψ` and a vector `v : F`, any continuous linear functional
`f` on `F` sends the test function `ψ • v` to the multiple `f v • ψ`; in particular the components
of `ψ • v` are the multiples `b.repr v i • ψ`. These identities reduce statements about
`F`-valued test functions to statements about real-valued ones.

## Main declarations

* `TestFunction.postcompCLM_postcompCLM`: postcomposing with `L₁` and then with `L₂` is
  postcomposing with `L₂ ∘L L₁`.
* `TestFunction.sum_postcompCLM_toSpanSingleton_coord`: an `F`-valued test function is the sum
  of its components in a basis, times the basis vectors.
* `TestFunction.postcompCLM_postcompCLM_toSpanSingleton`: a continuous linear functional applied
  to `ψ • v`.

/-- Postcomposing a test function with `L₁` and then with `L₂` is postcomposing it with
`L₂ ∘L L₁`. Unlike `SchwartzMap.postcompCLM_postcompCLM`, this is not a simp lemma: it would merge
the factors of the basis expansion in `sum_postcompCLM_toSpanSingleton_coord` into composites such
as `toSpanSingleton ℝ (b i) ∘L b.coord i`, which simp cannot evaluate further. -/
