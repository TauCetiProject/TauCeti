# Uniqueness of Fourier--Stieltjes measures on a Pontryagin dual

On a Polish Pontryagin dual, a finite measure is determined by the integrals of the evaluation
characters.  Equivalently, the Fourier--Stieltjes transform of a finite measure on the dual is
injective.  On the dual of an arbitrary locally compact abelian group, where the dual need be
neither metrizable nor second countable, the same holds for finite inner regular measures.  These
are the uniqueness halves of Bochner's theorem for locally compact abelian groups.

The proof packages finite linear combinations of evaluation characters as a star subalgebra of
bounded continuous functions.  Evaluation characters separate points of the dual simply because
two continuous homomorphisms that agree at every group element are equal.  Mathlib's extension
theorem for finite measures on Polish spaces, or its inner regular counterpart
`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.ext_of_forall_mem_subalgebra_integral_eq_of_innerRegular` on locally
compact Hausdorff spaces, then promotes equality of the character integrals to equality of the
measures.

The construction of `evalMonoidHom`, `evalAlgHom` and `evalPoly`, together with the proofs that
`evalPoly` is closed under `star` and separates points, is adapted from Jakob Stiefel's
`charMonoidHom`, `charAlgHom`, `charPoly`, `star_mem_range_charAlgHom` and
`separatesPoints_charPoly` in `Mathlib.Analysis.Fourier.BoundedContinuousFunctionChar`, which
treats characters of the form `v ↦ e (L v w)` on a real vector space.

## Main declarations

* `PontryaginDual.evalBoundedContinuous`: evaluation at a group element, bundled as a
  bounded continuous function on the dual.
* `PontryaginDual.evalPoly`: the star subalgebra of finite linear combinations of
  evaluation characters.
* `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.ext_of_forall_pontryaginMeasureTransform_eq`: finite measures on a
  Polish dual with the same Fourier--Stieltjes transform are equal.
* `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.ext_of_forall_pontryaginMeasureTransform_eq_of_innerRegular`:
  finite inner regular measures on the dual of a locally compact abelian group with the same
  Fourier--Stieltjes transform are equal.
