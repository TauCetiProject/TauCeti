# Bernstein's representation theorem (forward direction)

Bernstein's theorem represents a completely monotone function as the Laplace transform of a
positive measure on `[0, ∞)`. This file assembles the **forward direction** for
`TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone`, the closed-half-line notion from
`TauCeti.Analysis.CompletelyMonotone.Basic`: every completely monotone `f` is the Laplace
transform of a finite measure on `ℝ≥0` (`IsCompletelyMonotone.exists_measure`).

The Chafaï construction lives in the supporting files (`BernsteinAux`, `BernsteinMeasures`,
`BernsteinChafaiIdentity`, `BernsteinProkhorov`, `BernsteinKernelConv`); here we tie the pieces
together (`bernstein_theorem` on `Measure ℝ`) and transport the measure to `ℝ≥0` per the TauCeti
convention.

## Scope and the finite-vs-all-moments subtlety

We state only the forward existence here, with a **finite** representing measure — exactly what
complete monotonicity on the closed half-line yields. The *biconditional* is deferred (PR #2):
the converse "finite measure ⟹ completely monotone" is **false** for this closed-half-line
class — e.g. `t ↦ ∫₀^∞ e^{-x t}(1+x)⁻² dx` comes from a finite measure yet has `f'(0⁺) = -∞`,
so it is not `C^∞` at `0`. The class that closed complete monotonicity matches biconditionally
is the measures with **all moments finite**. See the `TODO` block at the end.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.laplaceTransformMeasure`: `t ↦ ∫ e^{-t x} dμ`, the Laplace transform of a measure
  on `ℝ≥0`.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.exists_measure`: every completely monotone function on
  `[0, ∞)` is the Laplace transform of a finite measure on `ℝ≥0`.
