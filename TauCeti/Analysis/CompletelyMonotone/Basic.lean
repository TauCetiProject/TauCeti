# Completely monotone functions

A function `f : ℝ → ℝ` is *completely monotone* if it is smooth on the closed half-line
`[0, ∞)` and its iterated derivatives there alternate in sign:
`(-1)ⁿ f⁽ⁿ⁾(t) ≥ 0` for every `n` and every `t ≥ 0`. Equivalently `f` is nonnegative,
nonincreasing, convex, and so on through every order. These are the functions that, by
Bernstein's theorem, are exactly the Laplace transforms of positive measures on `[0, ∞)`;
the prototypes `t ↦ e^{-x t}` (`x ≥ 0`) are the extreme rays out of which Bernstein's
theorem builds the general member.

The smoothness clause is essential and is not folded into the sign condition: an iterated
derivative defaults to a junk value where the function fails to be differentiable, so
without it a badly behaved `f` could satisfy `0 ≤ 0` vacuously. We phrase the sign condition
through `iteratedDerivWithin _ (Set.Ici 0)`, the derivative *within* the closed half-line,
which is the object that pairs cleanly with `ContDiffOn` (in particular at the boundary
point `0`); on the open half-line it agrees with the ordinary iterated derivative.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone`: the predicate that `f` is smooth and sign-alternating on
  `[0, ∞)`.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.nonneg`, `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.derivWithin_nonpos`,
  `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.antitoneOn`: a completely monotone function is nonnegative
  and nonincreasing on `[0, ∞)`.
* `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.add`, `TauCeti.IsCompletelyMonotone.const_smul`: closure under
  sums and nonnegative scalar multiples.
* `TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotone_const`: a nonnegative constant is completely monotone.
* `TauCeti.isCompletelyMonotone_exp_neg_mul`: the building block `t ↦ e^{-x t}` for `x ≥ 0`.
