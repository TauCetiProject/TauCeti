# The positive-definite function ↔ positive-definite kernel correspondence

A positive-definite function `F : M → ℂ` on an involutive additive monoid and a positive-definite
kernel `K : M → M → ℂ` are two views of the same data, linked by the assignment
`K(a, b) = F(a + b⋆)`. This file records the forward and reverse correspondence, packages them
as an iff, and records the translation-invariant group specialization.

Both predicates express nonnegativity of finite quadratic forms, with
`IsPositiveDefiniteKernel` using Mathlib's `Matrix.PosSemidef` convention for the two-variable
kernel.

Under the negation involution `a⋆ = -a` the kernel takes the familiar translation-invariant shape
`K(a, b) = F(a - b)`, the form in which positive definiteness is usually stated on groups such as
`ℝᵈ` or a real inner-product space. We record that specialization as a corollary parameterized by
the hypothesis `star a = -a` (Mathlib pins no such `StarAddMonoid` instance, since `star` is the
identity on a real vector space, so the negation involution is supplied as a side hypothesis rather
than an instance).

This advances the `OneParameterSemigroups` roadmap, Part C ("Positive-definite functions and
Bochner's theorem", `TauCetiRoadmap/OneParameterSemigroups/README.md`): the `API to develop` bullet
"the PD-function ↔ PD-kernel equivalence (`K(a, b) = F(a + b⋆)`; `F(a − b)` for a group)". The two
component predicates already live in TauCeti; this file is the equivalence connecting them, and the
group form. No Mathlib code is vendored.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.isPositiveDefinite_iff_isPositiveDefiniteKernel`: the equivalence of the two predicates,
  packaging the two halves.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.isPositiveDefiniteKernel_sub` and
  `TauCeti.isPositiveDefinite_iff_isPositiveDefiniteKernel_sub`: the subtraction form
  `K(a, b) = F(a - b)` under the negation involution `star a = -a`.
