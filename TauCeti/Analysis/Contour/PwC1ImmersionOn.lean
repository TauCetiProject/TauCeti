# Piecewise `C¹` immersions on an interval

The on-cycle Layer 4 targets of the contour-integration roadmap — the Hungerbühler–Wasem
generalized residue theorem and its half-residue specialisation — are stated for a **piecewise
`C¹` immersion**: a piecewise-`C¹` curve whose within-piece derivative is non-vanishing on every
closed piece, one-sided at the piece endpoints. This file introduces that regularity as the
predicate `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn γ a b` on the raw function `γ` — the roadmap's pinned
definition, verbatim — together with its basic API.

The non-vanishing tangent is what the on-cycle theory needs and the plain `IsPiecewiseC1On`
cannot supply: Hungerbühler–Wasem represent each on-cycle singularity by model sectors of a
definite opening angle, which requires a well-defined non-zero tangent there. The one-sided
conditions are load-bearing: merely asking `deriv γ ≠ 0` off a finite set would admit zero-speed
turnarounds (`γ t = t ^ 2` on `[-1, 1]`, whose one-sided tangents both vanish at `0`) and
zero-speed seams of a closed curve, which are not immersions. `derivWithin` is used because at a
corner the global `deriv` is `0` by Mathlib convention, which would falsely contradict
non-vanishing; at interior points of a piece it agrees with `deriv`. (The homology Cauchy
theorem, whose singularities lie *off* the curve, needs only `IsPiecewiseC1On`.)

## Main definitions

* `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn γ a b` — over a common finite breakpoint set, every breakpoint-free
  closed subinterval of `[[a, b]]` carries a `C¹` restriction with non-vanishing within-piece
  derivative.

## Main results

* `Contour.isPwC1ImmersionOn_iff` — unfold the predicate to its defining clauses.
* `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn.isPiecewiseC1On` — an immersion is in particular piecewise `C¹`,
  with the same breakpoint witness.
* `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn.continuousOn` — the underlying continuity on `[[a, b]]`.
* `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn.of_breakpoints`, `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn.exists_breakpoints` —
  introduce the predicate from, and eliminate it to, a finite breakpoint witness.
* `Contour.isPwC1ImmersionOn_comm`, `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn.symm` — endpoint-swap invariance.
* `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn.exists_deriv_right_limit`,
  `Contour.IsPwC1ImmersionOn.exists_deriv_left_limit` — the non-zero one-sided tangent limits,
  recovered from the within-piece derivative.

## Provenance

The raw-function mirror of the `ClosedPwC1Immersion` structure of the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms`
development (`PaperPwC1Immersion.lean`): the pieces clause matches its `contDiffOn_pieces` and
`derivWithin_ne_zero_pieces` fields — Hungerbühler–Wasem's `Λ̇|_{[aₖ,aₖ₊₁]} ≠ 0` (arXiv:1808.00997,
p. 3) — whose closed partition includes the interval endpoints, so the seam of a closed curve is
constrained too. Closedness itself (`γ a = γ b`) stays a separate hypothesis of the theorems. The
definition is pinned in the roadmap (`TauCetiRoadmap/ContourIntegration/Suggested.lean`).

/-- **Piecewise-`C¹` immersion on the interval between `a` and `b`.** The curve `γ : ℝ → ℂ` is
continuous on `[[a, b]]` and, over a common finite breakpoint set
`p ⊆ (min a b, max a b)`, every breakpoint-free closed subinterval `[c, d]` carries a `C¹`
restriction whose within-piece derivative is non-vanishing on **all** of `[c, d]` — one-sided at
the piece endpoints, including at `a` and `b`. This strengthens `IsPiecewiseC1On` by a
non-vanishing tangent on every piece (`IsPwC1ImmersionOn.isPiecewiseC1On`); the `c < d` guard
excludes degenerate pieces, on which `derivWithin` is not meaningful. -/
