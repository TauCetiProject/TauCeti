# The Hungerbühler–Wasem crossing angle and regularity conditions (A′) and (B)

For a curve `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on `[a, b]` and an integrand `f : ℂ → ℂ`, this file defines the **crossing
angle** and the **flatness** of `γ` at a time, and the roadmap's two Hungerbühler–Wasem regularity
conditions at its on-curve singularities: the geometric flatness condition **(A′)** and the analytic
sector-cancellation condition **(B)**, the two regularity hypotheses of the generalized residue
theorem (HW Thm 3.3), evaluating the Cauchy principal value `PV ∮_γ f`. Condition (A′) asks that
at each prescribed singularity `s ∈ S` the curve `γ` be **flat of order equal to the order of `f`'s
pole there** — with a one-sided tangent line at a simple pole, hugged ever tighter at a higher-order
pole — and that it meet each `s` only finitely often. Condition (B) governs poles of order
`> 1`, coupling the Laurent principal part of `f` at each such pole with the entry/exit tangents of
`γ` there, via a sector-cancellation identity; simple poles need no sector condition.

## Main definitions

* `crossingAngle γ t₀` — the model-sector opening angle in `[0, 2π)`, from the reversed entry
  tangent `−L₋` to the exit tangent `L₊` (`mod 2π`), where `L₋`, `L₊` are the one-sided limits of
  `deriv γ` from the left and right at `t₀`. Junk when a one-sided tangent fails to exist; a smooth
  crossing gives `π` (`crossingAngle_eq_pi`). Meaningful at the corners/crossings of a
  piecewise-`C¹` curve.
* `basepointAngle γ a b` — the analogous opening angle at the join `γ a = γ b` of a closed curve,
  from the reversed incoming tangent at `b` to the outgoing tangent at `a`.
* `FlatOfOrder γ t₀ n` — `γ` is **flat of order `n`** at `t₀` (HW Def. 3.2): from each side the
  perpendicular distance from `γ t` to a one-sided tangent line at `γ t₀` is `o(‖γ t − γ t₀‖ⁿ)`.
  Order `1` gives a one-sided tangent line; larger `n` hugs the line more tightly.
* `FlatOfOrderBasepoint γ a b n` — the analogue at the join `γ a = γ b` of a closed curve, for the
  outgoing branch at `a` (from the right) and the incoming branch at `b` (from the left).
* `ConditionAprime γ a b f S` — HW condition (A′), a structure requiring `γ` to meet each `s ∈ S`
  finitely often (`finite_crossings`) and be flat of order `n` wherever `f` has a pole of order `n`
  there (`interior`, `basepoint`). Pole orders come from `f` via `meromorphicOrderAt`; `S` selects
  the singularities.
* `SectorCompatible f z₀ θ` — the one-crossing Hungerbühler–Wasem sector condition, a structure with
  fields `angle_rational` (`θ` is a rational multiple of `π`) and `laurent_compatible` (the Laurent
  principal part of `f` at `z₀` resonates with `θ`).
* `ConditionB γ a b f` — HW condition (B), a structure imposing `SectorCompatible` at every
  higher-order (order `> 1`) on-curve pole of `f`: at each interior crossing (`ConditionB.interior`)
  and at the basepoint (`ConditionB.basepoint`).
* `FlatOfOrder.of_le` and `pow_unit_tangent_eq_of_resonance` — the consuming bridges: flatness
  restricts downward in the order, and the sector resonance `k · θ ∈ 2π · ℤ` at the crossing
  angle is the power equation of the unit tangent directions.

Both conditions read the on-curve pole orders of `f` from `meromorphicOrderAt`. Condition (B) needs
no explicit singular set — it fires **intrinsically** at the times `t₀` where
`meromorphicOrderAt f (γ t₀) < -1` (a pole of order `> 1`), so it is `S`-free. Condition (A′) is
imposed at the prescribed set `S` (selecting the singularities), with the required flatness order
taken from `f`. Both match the roadmap signatures and the way the residue theorem consumes them.

## Provenance

Migrated and adapted from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project (`angleAtCrossing`, `FlatOfOrder`,
and `SatisfiesConditionB`), specialised to the raw-function (`γ : ℝ → ℂ` on `[a, b]`) design of the
contour-integration roadmap. `FlatOfOrder` here uses HW Def. 3.2's tangent-*line* (orthogonal
projection) distance, so it is speed-independent at every order. Condition (A′) matches the flatness
order to `f`'s pole order at each `s ∈ S`; condition (B) detects the higher-order poles of
`f` intrinsically via `meromorphicOrderAt`.

/-- **Crossing angle** of `γ : ℝ → ℂ` at a time `t₀`, valued in `[0, 2π)`: the opening angle of the
model sector, from the reversed entry tangent `−L₋` to the exit tangent `L₊`, taken `mod 2π`. Here
`L₋ = lim_{t → t₀⁻} γ'(t)`, `L₊ = lim_{t → t₀⁺} γ'(t)` are the one-sided limits of `deriv γ`. The
normalization keeps it nonnegative: a **smooth** crossing (`L₊ = L₋`) gives `π`, as in HW §3. As a
`limUnder`-based value it is junk when a one-sided tangent fails to exist; it is meaningful at the
corners/crossings of a piecewise-`C¹` curve. -/

analogue at the basepoint, where the two tangents come from opposite ends of `[a, b]`; a smooth join

one-sided **tangent line** through `γ t₀`, its perpendicular distance to that line vanishing faster
than `‖γ t − γ t₀‖ⁿ`. There are nonzero one-sided directions `v_plus` (right) and `v_minus` (left)
for which the component of `γ t − γ t₀` orthogonal to `v` — of length
`|((γ t − γ t₀) · conj v).im| / ‖v‖`, the distance from `γ t` to the line `γ t₀ + ℝ • v` — is
`o(‖γ t − γ t₀‖ⁿ)` as `t → t₀⁺`, symmetrically as `t → t₀⁻`. Order `1` is first-order tangency to a
line; larger `n` forces it to hug the line ever more tightly. Distance is measured to the tangent
*line*, not to a moving point on it, so flatness ignores the along-tangent speed, as in HW. -/

of the integrand `f`: `γ` meets each singularity only **finitely often** and is **flat** to the
order of `f`'s pole there. Wherever `γ` meets a point of `S` at which `f` has a pole of order `n`,
the curve is flat of order `n` — tangent to a line at a simple pole, flatter at a higher pole — and
each such `s` is met only finitely often. Together with
condition (B) it is a regularity hypothesis of the generalized residue theorem (HW Thm 3.3). It is
imposed at each *interior* crossing `t₀` strictly between the endpoints and at the *basepoint*
`γ (min a b)` (`= γ (max a b)` for a closed curve), so a join singularity is not left free. The
clauses are stated over `min`/`max`, so the condition is invariant under swapping the endpoints

/-! ### Consuming the conditions

The two bridges from the conditions' data to the raw hypotheses the principal-value theorems
take: flatness restricts downward in the order, and the sector resonance `k · θ ∈ 2π · ℤ` at
the crossing angle is the power equation of the unit tangent directions. -/

/-- **Flatness restricts downward**: a curve flat of order `n` at `t₀` is flat of every order
`m ≤ n` — near the crossing the chord is small, so a higher power of it is the stronger
bound. -/

/-- **Resonance to tangent powers**: if `k · crossingAngle γ t₀` is a multiple of `2π` and the
one-sided derivative limits at `t₀` are `L_R` and `L_L`, both non-zero, then the `k`-th powers
of the unit tangent directions agree — the raw sector equation the higher-order
principal-value theorems consume. -/
