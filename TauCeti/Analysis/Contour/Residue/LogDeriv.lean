# The residue of the logarithmic derivative is the meromorphic order

For `f : ℂ → ℂ` meromorphic at `z₀` of order `n = meromorphicOrderAt f z₀`, the residue of the
logarithmic derivative there is exactly that order:
`TauCeti.Contour.residue (logDeriv f) z₀ = n`. This is the residue-form of the argument principle,
the identity `Res_{z₀}(f'/f) = ord_{z₀} f` that the roadmap names as the local statement its
contour form (`TauCeti.Contour.argumentPrinciple`) integrates: a zero of order `k` contributes
`+k` and a pole of order `k` contributes `−k`.

The mechanism is the simple-pole splitting of the logarithmic derivative
(`TauCeti.Contour.logDeriv_eventuallyEq_principalPart`): near `z₀` there is `g` analytic and
non-vanishing with `logDeriv f = n · (· − z₀)⁻¹ + logDeriv g` on a punctured neighbourhood. The
analytic tail `logDeriv g` contributes no residue, so only the simple-pole principal part
`n · (· − z₀)⁻¹` survives, whose residue is `n` by
`TauCeti.Contour.residue_const_mul_sub_inv` (the elementary simple-pole residues live in
`TauCeti.Analysis.Contour.Residue.SimplePole`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Contour.residue_logDeriv_eq_meromorphicOrderAt` — `residue (logDeriv f) z₀ = n` when
  `meromorphicOrderAt f z₀ = n`: the residue of `f'/f` is the order of `f` at `z₀`.

These are Layer 2 targets of the contour-integration roadmap, feeding the argument principle and,
ultimately, the valence formula's interior-orbit sum.

## Provenance

The simple-pole splitting `logDeriv_eventuallyEq_principalPart` and the residue API are adapted from
the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project (the argument-principle and residue material of
`ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/Residue.lean` and
`.../Residue/GeneralizedTheoremBase.lean`, where the residue theorem is applied to `logDeriv f`),
here specialised to Mathlib's `meromorphicOrderAt` API and the raw-function design of the
contour-integration roadmap.

/-- **The residue of the logarithmic derivative is the meromorphic order.** If `f` is meromorphic at
`z₀` of order `n` (`meromorphicOrderAt f z₀ = n`), then `residue (logDeriv f) z₀ = n`: the residue
of `f'/f` counts the order of `f` at `z₀` — positive at a zero, negative at a pole. This is the
local, residue-form of the argument principle `TauCeti.Contour.argumentPrinciple`, the identity
`Res_{z₀}(f'/f) = ord_{z₀} f`. -/
