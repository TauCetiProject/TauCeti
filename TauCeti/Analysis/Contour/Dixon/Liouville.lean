# The Dixon function vanishes (Liouville step)

Dixon's glued function `dixonFunction f U γ a b` is entire (`differentiable_dixonFunction`) and,
for a closed null-homologous curve, tends to `0` at infinity, so Liouville's theorem forces it to
vanish identically. The decay comes from the eventual agreement `dixonFunction = dixonH2` far from
the origin — off `U` by definition, and on `U` because the winding number is eventually `0`, which
collapses the `h₁`/`h₂` identity — combined with the `L¹` decay of `dixonH2`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Contour.dixonFunction_eq_zero` — `dixonFunction f U γ a b w = 0` for every `w`, for a
  closed null-homologous curve in `U` with `f` differentiable on the open set `U`.

This pointwise vanishing is the hinge of Dixon's proof of the homology form of Cauchy's theorem
(`homologyCauchyTheorem`, `TauCetiRoadmap/ContourIntegration/Suggested.lean`): applying it to
`(· - w₀) * f` yields the Cauchy integral formula and thence `∮_γ f = 0`.

## Provenance

Adapted from `dixonFunction_eventually_eq_dixonH2`, `dixonFunction_tendsto_zero` and
`dixonFunction_eq_zero` in `DixonTheorem.lean` of the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` development,
restated for a raw `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on an oriented interval. See J. D. Dixon, *A brief proof of Cauchy's
integral theorem* (1971).

/-- **The Dixon function eventually agrees with `dixonH2` along `cocompact ℂ`.** For a closed curve
`γ` continuous on `uIcc a b`, differentiable off a countable set, with interval-integrable
derivative and image in `U`, every `w` far from the origin lies off the curve with winding number
`0` (`windingNumber_eventually_zero_cocompact`). There `dixonFunction = dixonH2`: off `U` by
definition, and on `U` because the vanishing winding number collapses the `h₁`/`h₂` identity. -/

/-- **The Dixon function tends to `0` along `cocompact ℂ`.** It eventually agrees with `dixonH2`,
which tends to `0` by the `L¹` decay bound: the image of the compact interval `uIcc a b` is bounded
(`IsCompact.exists_bound_of_continuousOn`), and the weight `f (γ ·) * deriv γ` is
interval-integrable (continuous `f ∘ γ` times the interval-integrable derivative). -/
