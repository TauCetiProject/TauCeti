# Infinite products of power series in the coefficientwise topology

If all but finitely many factors agree with `1` to each prescribed degree, their product
converges coefficientwise. Each coefficient is computed from any finite cutoff containing all
factors that can affect it.

## Main results

* `PowerSeries.WithPiTopology.hasProd_of_X_pow_dvd_sub_one`: convergence and finite-cutoff
  coefficients for products whose factors approach `1` modulo increasing powers of `X`.

/-- **Infinite products through finite cutoffs.** If, for each `n`, every factor `g i` with
`i ∉ F n` is congruent to `1` modulo `X ^ (n + 1)`, then the product of all the `g i` converges
in the coefficientwise topology, and its `n`-th coefficient is that of `∏ i ∈ F n, g i`. -/
