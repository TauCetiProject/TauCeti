# Restricted power series with a vanishing tail

Mathlib's `PowerSeries.IsRestricted` asks the weighted coefficient norms of a power series to
tend to zero. A series whose coefficients vanish in every degree past some bound — a polynomial —
satisfies that condition at every radius, and this file records the resulting introduction rule,
together with the membership rule for Mathlib's subring of restricted power series.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.isRestricted_of_forall_coeff_eq_zero`: a series with a vanishing tail is
  restricted at every radius.
* `TauCeti.PowerSeries.mem_isRestricted_subring_iff`: membership in Mathlib's subring of restricted
  power series is restrictedness.

/-- A power series whose coefficients vanish in every degree `≥ n` is restricted at every radius:
its weighted coefficient norms are eventually zero. Such a series is a polynomial of degree less
