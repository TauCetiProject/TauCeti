# A local ring is its own localization at the maximal ideal

Every element of a local ring `S` outside its maximal ideal is a unit, so the localization of `S`
at its maximal ideal inverts only units and is `S` itself (Mathlib `IsLocalization.atUnits`).
This file names that equivalence, as an isomorphism of `R`-algebras for any `R`-algebra
structure on `S`, so that statements about `Localization.AtPrime (maximalIdeal S)` transfer to
`S` along a single map.

## Main definitions

* `IsLocalRing.algEquivLocalizationAtMaximalIdeal R S`: the `R`-algebra isomorphism from a local
  ring `S` to its localization at its maximal ideal.
