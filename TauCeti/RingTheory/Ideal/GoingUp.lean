# Lying over along an integral ring homomorphism

An integral ring homomorphism `g : S →+* T` lifts each prime ideal of `S` containing its kernel
to a prime ideal of `T`. This is Mathlib's `Ideal.exists_ideal_over_prime_of_isIntegral` stated
directly for `g`, so callers need not install an algebra structure.

Along an integral algebra, maximal ideals contract to maximal ideals, so the extension of an
ideal contained in the Jacobson radical is again contained in the Jacobson radical.

## Main results

* `Ideal.exists_comap_eq_of_isIntegral`: a prime of `S` containing the kernel of `g` is the
  contraction along `g` of a prime of `T`.
* `Ideal.primesOver_eq_singleton_under_of_primesOver_eq_singleton`: a prime alone above `p` in
  `T` contracts to a prime alone above `p` in any intermediate ring over which `T` is integral.
* `Ideal.map_le_jacobson_bot_of_isIntegral`: along an integral algebra, the extension of an ideal
  in the Jacobson radical lies in the Jacobson radical.
