# Invariant rings and localization

Let a group `G` act on a commutative ring `A` by ring automorphisms, and write `Aᴳ` for the
invariant subring `FixedPoints.subring A G`. This file compares invariants with localization.

For a submonoid `M` of invariant elements, the action extends to the localization `M⁻¹A`
(`Localization (Algebra.algebraMapSubmonoid A M)`), compatibly with `A → M⁻¹A`. When `G` is
finite, taking invariants commutes with this localization: `(M⁻¹A)ᴳ` is the localization of `Aᴳ`
at `M`. A fraction `a / s` fixed by every `g` satisfies `t_g (g • a - a) = 0` for some `t_g ∈ M`,
which can be replaced by the product `t` of the `t_g` because `G` is finite, and then
`a / s = t a / (s t)` with `t a` invariant. Taking `M` to be the powers of an invariant `r` gives
the localization `A[1/r]` of `A` at `r`. The argument only uses finitely many ring endomorphisms
compatible with the localization map, and is stated in that form for an arbitrary localization
`S` of `A`, whose fixed elements are described by an arbitrary ring `R'` mapping injectively to
`S` (`TauCeti.FixedPoints.isLocalization_of_mem_range_iff`).

Also for finite `G`, the local homomorphism `(Aᴳ)_P → A_Q` induced by `Aᴳ ⊆ A` at a prime `Q` of
`A` lying over a prime `P` of `Aᴳ` is injective. If an invariant `a` is killed by some `t ∉ Q`,
prime avoidance applied to the annihilator of `a`, which is `G`-stable, and the finitely many
primes `g⁻¹ • Q` gives such a `t` outside every `g⁻¹ • Q`; then the invariant `∏ g, g • t` lies
outside `P` and kills `a`.

These are the two local facts behind the categorical universal property of the affine invariant
quotient `Spec A ⟶ Spec Aᴳ` for arbitrary target schemes.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.FixedPoints.localizationRingAut M`: the action of `G` on `M⁻¹A` for a submonoid `M`
  of invariants, which provides the instance
  `MulSemiringAction G (Localization (Algebra.algebraMapSubmonoid A M))`.
* The instance `Algebra (FixedPoints.subring A G)
  (FixedPoints.subring (Localization (Algebra.algebraMapSubmonoid A M)) G)` given by `A → M⁻¹A`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FixedPoints.smul_algebraMap_localization`: `A → M⁻¹A` is `G`-equivariant.
* `TauCeti.FixedPoints.smul_mk'`: `G` acts on a fraction `a / s` through its numerator.
* `TauCeti.FixedPoints.isLocalization_of_mem_range_iff`: the elements of a localization fixed by
  finitely many compatible ring endomorphisms are the localization of the fixed elements.
* `TauCeti.FixedPoints.isLocalization`: for finite `G`, `(M⁻¹A)ᴳ` is the localization of `Aᴳ`
  at `M`.
* `TauCeti.FixedPoints.localRingHom_injective`: for finite `G`, `(Aᴳ)_P → A_Q` is injective.

/-- **Fixed elements commute with localization.** Let `S` be a localization of `A` at the image of
a submonoid `M` of `R`, and let finitely many ring endomorphisms `σ i` of `A` and `τ i` of `S` be
compatible with `A → S`. If `R → A` and `R' → S` are injective with images the elements fixed by
every `σ i`, respectively every `τ i`, and `R → R'` is compatible with them, then `R'` is the
localization of `R` at `M`. A fraction `a / s` fixed by every `τ i` satisfies
`t_i (σ i a - a) = 0` for some `t_i ∈ M`, which can be replaced by the product `t` of the `t_i`
since there are finitely many `i`; then `a / s = t a / (s t)` with `t a` fixed. -/
