# Projective dimension over the perfection of a ring with flat Frobenius

Let `K` be a ring of exponential characteristic `p` whose Frobenius endomorphism is flat, and
suppose that every `K`-module has projective dimension at most `d`. Then every module over a
perfect closure `i : K →+* L`, for instance Mathlib's colimit perfection `PerfectClosure K p`, has
projective dimension at most `d + 1`. By Kunz's theorem this applies to a regular ring `K` of
Krull dimension at most `d`, whose Frobenius is flat and whose modules have projective dimension
at most `d`: the perfection of a regular ring of finite Krull dimension has finite global
dimension.

The perfect closure `L` is the union of the increasing sequence of subrings `i(K) ^ (1 / p ^ n)`,
the images of `x ↦ i(x) ^ (1 / p ^ n)`. Each of them is isomorphic to `K` because `i` is
injective: its kernel is the `p`-nilradical of `K`, which vanishes because flat Frobenius is
injective. The perfect closure is flat over each of them because it is flat over `K`
(`RingHom.Flat.of_isPerfectClosure`). Every module over `L` is then the colimit of its base
changes from these subrings, which have projective dimension at most `d`, and the telescope
sequence adds one (`ModuleCat.hasProjectiveDimensionLT_succ_of_iSup_eq_top`).

Bhatt and Scholze use this bound for the perfection `P` of a regular ring, and then transport it
along a surjection from `P` onto a perfect ring, to bound the projective dimension of modules over
perfectly finitely presented algebras over the perfection of a regular ring.

## Main results

* `IsPerfectClosure.hasProjectiveDimensionLE_succ`: if Frobenius of `K` is flat and every
  `K`-module has projective dimension at most `d`, then every module over a perfect closure of
  `K` has projective dimension at most `d + 1`.
* `IsPerfectClosure.hasProjectiveDimensionLE_succ_of_isRegularRing`: over a perfect closure of a
  regular ring of Krull dimension at most `d`, every module has projective dimension at most
  `d + 1`.
