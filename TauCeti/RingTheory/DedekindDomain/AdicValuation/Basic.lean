# Normalized valuations of the fraction field of a Dedekind domain are adic

Mathlib attaches to every height one prime `𝔭` of a Dedekind domain `R` a normalized
`ℤᵐ⁰`-valued valuation `𝔭.valuation K` of the fraction field `K`, and shows that distinct primes
give inequivalent valuations. This file proves the converse: a normalized valuation of `K` whose
valuation ring contains `R` *is* `𝔭.valuation K` for a unique height one prime `𝔭` of `R`, namely
the centre of the valuation on `R`.

## Main definitions

* `Valuation.centerIdeal`: the centre `{r : R | w r < 1}` on `R` of a valuation `w` of `K` whose
  valuation ring contains `R`.
* `Valuation.heightOneSpectrum`: that centre, bundled as a height one prime of `R`.

## Main results

* `Valuation.eq_valuation_of_forall_mem_asIdeal_iff`: a normalized valuation bounded by `1` on `R`
  and of positive value exactly on a height one prime `𝔭` is the adic valuation of `𝔭`.
* `Valuation.valuation_heightOneSpectrum`: the adic valuation of the centre of `w` on `R` is `w`.
* `Valuation.existsUnique_heightOneSpectrum_valuation_eq`: the centre is the only height one prime
  whose adic valuation is `w`.

## Implementation notes

The comparison goes through `Valuation.isEquiv_iff_val_le_one` and the normalization lemma
`Valuation.eq_of_isEquiv_of_surjective`: both valuations are surjective onto `ℤᵐ⁰`, so it is
enough to see that they have the same valuation ring. That in turn uses only that the two
valuations are bounded by `1` on `R` and are `< 1` on the same elements of `R`, together with
Mathlib's `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.exists_primeCompl_mul_eq_or_mul_eq`, which writes an
arbitrary element of `K` as a fraction with denominator outside `𝔭`, in one of the two possible
directions.

Bundling the centre as a height one prime needs `w` to be nontrivial, and nothing more; the
normalization theorems need the stronger `Function.Surjective w`, from which the nontriviality
instance is installed on the spot through `Valuation.isNontrivial_of_surjective`, so that
surjectivity is their only valuation hypothesis.

`Valuation.centerIdeal` and `Valuation.heightOneSpectrum` keep their bodies unexposed; the
characterization lemmas `Valuation.mem_centerIdeal` and `Valuation.asIdeal_heightOneSpectrum` are
the interface. The latter's definitional proof is parenthesized (`(rfl)`) so that it is not inferred
to be `@[defeq]`, which would require the body to be exposed.
