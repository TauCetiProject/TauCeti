# Smooth cutoff functions around compact sets

On a Hausdorff manifold modelled on a finite-dimensional real space, a compact set `K` inside an
open set `W` has a smooth cutoff function: a smooth `σ : M → [0, 1]`, equal to `1` on a
neighbourhood of `K`, whose support is a compact subset of `W`
(`IsCompact.exists_contMDiff_one_nhds_tsupport_subset`).

Mathlib's smooth Urysohn lemma `exists_contMDiffMap_one_nhds_of_subset_interior` gives such a
function for a closed set, but assumes the manifold σ-compact and does not make the support
compact. Here neither is needed, since finitely many bump functions cover `K`. Cutoffs of this
form extend a vector field given near a compact set to a compactly supported one, and so a
complete one.

The construction, smoothing a finite sum of bump functions by `Real.smoothTransition`, follows the
bump cover in the proof of `TauCeti.exists_vectorField_mvfderiv_eq_neg_one`.

/-- **A smooth cutoff around a compact set.** If `K` is a compact subset of an open set `W` of a
Hausdorff manifold modelled on a finite-dimensional space, there is a smooth function
`σ : M → [0, 1]` equal to `1` on a neighbourhood of `K` whose topological support is a compact
subset of `W`. -/
