# Relative diffeomorphism groups

This file records the pointwise fixing subgroup for the diffeomorphism action, with
boundary-specific specializations.  The geometric-topology roadmap's layer on diffeomorphism
groups asks for the relative group `Diff(M, ∂M)`, the diffeomorphisms fixing the boundary
pointwise, as soon as `Diff(M)` itself is available as a group.  The underlying subgroup is
Mathlib's `fixingSubgroup` applied directly to the relevant set of points.

## Main definitions

* `Diffeomorph.fixedOnSubgroup I n s`: the subgroup fixing `s` pointwise.
* `Diffeomorph.boundaryFixingSubgroup I n`: the subgroup fixing `I.boundary M` pointwise, the
  group-level precursor of `Diff(M, ∂M)`.

## Main results

* `Diffeomorph.mem_fixedOnSubgroup_iff`: membership in `fixedOnSubgroup` means pointwise fixing.
* `Diffeomorph.fixedOnSubgroup_empty`, `Diffeomorph.fixedOnSubgroup_union`,
  `Diffeomorph.fixedOnSubgroup_iUnion`, and `Diffeomorph.fixedOnSubgroup_antitone`: the
  standard set-operation API for fixing subgroups specialized to diffeomorphisms.
* `Diffeomorph.fixedOnSubgroup_fixedPoints_gc`: the Galois connection between fixed-on
  subgroups and fixed points for the diffeomorphism action.
* `Diffeomorph.mem_boundaryFixingSubgroup_iff`: membership in `boundaryFixingSubgroup` means
  pointwise boundary fixing.
* `Diffeomorph.toHomeomorphHom_mem_fixingSubgroup_of_mem_fixedOnSubgroup`: a set-fixing
  diffeomorphism maps to a set-fixing homeomorphism under the forgetful homomorphism.
* `Diffeomorph.toHomeomorphHom_mem_fixingSubgroup_boundary_of_mem_boundaryFixingSubgroup`: a
  boundary-fixing diffeomorphism maps to a boundary-fixing homeomorphism under the forgetful
  homomorphism.
