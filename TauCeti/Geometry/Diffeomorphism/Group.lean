# The group of self-diffeomorphisms

Mathlib's `Diffeomorph I I' M M' n` is the type of `Cⁿ` diffeomorphisms between two manifolds,
with composition (`Diffeomorph.trans`), inverse (`Diffeomorph.symm`), and the identity
(`Diffeomorph.refl`) already in place. When the source and target coincide these assemble into a
group: this file equips the self-diffeomorphisms `M ≃ₘ^n⟮I, I⟯ M` with `One`, `Mul`, and `Inv`
instances and proves the `Group` axioms, exactly as Mathlib does for `Equiv.Perm`
(`Mathlib/Algebra/Group/End.lean`). The multiplication is `f * g = g.trans f`, so that `f * g`
acts as the function composition `f ∘ g`, matching the `Equiv.Perm` convention.

This is the group object the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`, layer 3, "diffeomorphism groups with the C^∞
topology") asks for as its first deliverable: "The **group** `Diff(M) := M ≃ₘ^∞⟮I, I⟯ M` under
composition (the `Group` instance is routine from the existing `Diffeomorph` composition and
inverse)." It is the underlying group of the topological group `Diff(M)` whose homotopy type the
Smale conjecture `[Kir97, Problem 4.34]` is about; the C^∞ topology making it a topological group is
a separate, later layer-3 deliverable, so this file stops at the bare group structure. The
construction works for every smoothness exponent `n`, with `n = ∞` the case named by the roadmap.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Diff I M n`: notation/abbreviation for the group `M ≃ₘ^n⟮I, I⟯ M` of `Cⁿ`
  self-diffeomorphisms of `M`.
* the `One`, `Mul`, `Inv`, and `Group` instances on `M ≃ₘ^n⟮I, I⟯ M`.
* `TauCeti.Diffeomorph.toPerm`: the forgetful group homomorphism to the underlying permutation
  group `Equiv.Perm M`, which is injective.
* `TauCeti.Diffeomorph.toHomeomorphHom`: the forgetful group homomorphism to the underlying
  homeomorphism group, which is injective.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Diffeomorph.mul_apply` / `one_apply` / `inv_apply` and the `coe_*` companions: the group
  operations act by composition, the identity, and the inverse diffeomorphism.
