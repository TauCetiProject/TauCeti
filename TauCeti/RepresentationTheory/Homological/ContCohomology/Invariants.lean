# Invariants of a discrete module as a module over a quotient

For a normal subgroup `H` of `G` acting distributively on an additive group `M`, the invariants
`M ^ H` carry a distributive action of `G ⧸ H`. Over a profinite `G` with `H` open normal this is
the coefficient system of the finite-level tower computing continuous cohomology: the finite group
`G ⧸ H` acts on the discrete module `M ^ H`, and shrinking `H` enlarges `M ^ H` along transition
inclusions. For a general normal `H` the same quotient action is the coefficient half of
inflation, and it is again continuous as soon as the `G`-action on the discrete module `M` is.

The invariant subgroup `M ^ H` is Mathlib's `FixedPoints.addSubgroup H M`; no second name for it is
introduced here, and its distributive `G`- and `G ⧸ H`-actions are the generic ones supplied by
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/GroupAction/FixedPoints.lean`, together with the generic transition
inclusions and coefficient-map functoriality. What this file adds is the topology: the two
finite-level facts the tower needs — directedness over the open normal subgroups and continuity of
the discrete quotient action — together with the two facts inflation needs, namely continuity of
the `G ⧸ H`-action for an *arbitrary* normal `H` over a continuously acting `G`, and continuity of
the inclusion `M ^ H ↪ M`.

The fixed-point functoriality and finite-level facts are first stated for an additive monoid with a
distributive `G`-action, then specialized to `FixedPoints.addSubgroup` for additive groups; an
abelian group gives the usual discrete-module theory. The topology classes are added only where
continuity is used, and no new bundling structure is introduced, so instance search composes the
unbundled classes freely.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.directed_fixedPoints_addSubmonoid` and
  `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPointsAddSubmonoid`, with their additive-subgroup forms
  `TauCeti.directed_fixedPoints_addSubgroup` and `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPoints`:
  the fixed points over the open normal subgroups form a directed family, and each carries a
  continuous action of the discrete quotient group.
* `TauCeti.continuous_fixedPoints_addSubgroup_subtype`: the inclusion `M ^ H ↪ M` is continuous,
  in the `AddSubgroup.subtype` spelling that the compatible pairs of inflation need.
* `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPointsOfContinuousSMul`: for an *arbitrary* normal subgroup
  `H` of a group with a topology acting continuously on a discrete module, the quotient `G ⧸ H`
  acts continuously on `M ^ H`; no compatibility of the topology of `G` with its group structure
  is used.
* `TauCeti.continuous_fixedPointsPairing`: a jointly continuous equivariant pairing remains
  jointly continuous after restriction to invariant coefficients.

## Roadmap

This file addresses the "Constructions" bullet of Layer 0 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/README.md`, which asks for the invariants `M ^ U` as a
`G ⧸ U`-module with their induced discrete action, together with that layer's API line for `M ^ U`:
the inclusions `M ^ U ↪ M ^ V` and `M ^ U ↪ M`, functoriality in `M` along equivariant maps and in
`U` along inclusions, and the edge cases at `⊥` and `⊤`. Milestones 2 and 3 of Layer 4's transition
system — the coefficient inclusion and its equivariance after restriction along the quotient
homomorphism — are exactly those Layer 0 items, supplied by the imported generic fixed-point API;
milestones 5 and 6 are the identity and composition laws of the *induced map on cohomology* and
need Layers 1 to 3, so the generic identity and composition laws are the coefficient-inclusion half
they will rest on.
The "Openness" bullet of Layer 0 lives in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/Discrete.lean` and is not restated here.
Directedness is what makes Layer 4's colimit over the finite quotients filtered.

`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/Inflation.lean` need the statement in the

/-- For an arbitrary normal subgroup `H`, the action of `G ⧸ H` on the invariants `M ^ H` of a
discrete module is continuous. Unlike
`TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPoints`, which reads the continuity off the discreteness of
`G ⧸ H` for open `H` and needs no continuity of the `G`-action, this deduces it from continuity of
the `G`-action: the invariants are discrete, so continuity is continuity in the group variable
alone, and there it is the continuity of the `G`-action read through the quotient map. No
compatibility of the topology of `G` with its group structure is needed, since `G ⧸ H` carries the
quotient topology. -/
