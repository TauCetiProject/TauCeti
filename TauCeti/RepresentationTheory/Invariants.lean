# Invariants of group representations

Mathlib names the group sum `∑ g, ρ g` of a finite-group representation `Representation.norm`,
builds the averaging projection `Representation.averageMap` separately out of the group-algebra
element `GroupAlgebra.average`, and records that the latter projects onto the invariants
(`Representation.isProj_averageMap`). What it does not record is how the two operators relate.
The group sum is the shape a symmetrization operator actually takes at a use site, where the
normalizing factor `⅟(#G)` is usually left implicit, and reinstating it by hand is the step that
gets rewritten.

This file supplies the bridge. Unfolding the group algebra once identifies `averageMap` with
`norm` scaled by `⅟(#G)`, and since scaling by a unit changes no image, `norm` has the same range
as the projection: the invariants.

## Main results

* `Representation.averageMap_eq_invOf_card_smul_norm`: the averaging projection is the group sum
  `Representation.norm` scaled by the inverse of the group order.
* `Representation.range_norm_eq_invariants`: the group sum `Representation.norm ρ` has the
  invariants as its range.
* `Rep.FiniteCyclicGroup.invariants_eq_ker_apply_sub`: for a cyclic group, the invariants are the
  kernel of the action of a generator minus the identity.

`Representation.averageMap` through the group algebra; this unfolds that definition to the group sum
`Representation.norm`, scaled by the inverse of the group order. -/

/-- **The group sum has the invariants as its range.** When `#G` is invertible in `k`, the operator
`Representation.norm ρ = ∑ g, ρ g` maps onto the invariants of `ρ`: it agrees with the averaging
projection up to the unit `#G`, so the two have the same image. -/
