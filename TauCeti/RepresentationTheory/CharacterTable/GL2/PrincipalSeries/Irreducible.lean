# The principal series of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` is irreducible exactly off the diagonal

The principal series `Ind_B^{GL₂}(α ⊗ β)` of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` is irreducible if and only if the two
characters `α, β : 𝔽_qˣ → ℂˣ` are distinct. This file proves that, the last of the three
statements the character-theory roadmap asks of the principal series; the other two, its
definition and its dimension `q + 1`, are in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/PrincipalSeries/Basic.lean`.

The proof is the Mackey irreducibility criterion `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff` run against the
Bruhat decomposition. The criterion says that `Ind_B^{GL₂} A` is irreducible exactly when `A` is
irreducible and, for every `s ∉ B`, the restrictions of `A` and of its conjugate `{}^s A` to
`B ⊓ sBs⁻¹` share no nonzero intertwiner. The Borel representation `α ⊗ β` is a line, hence
irreducible, and Bruhat collapses the second condition: every `s ∉ B` is `b₁ w b₂` for the Weyl
element `w = !![0, 1; 1, 0]`, and Mackey disjointness depends only on the double coset
(`TauCeti.mackeyDisjoint_mul_left_mul_right_iff`), so the whole criterion becomes one condition
at `w`.

At `w` the two restrictions are again lines, so Schur's lemma
(`FDRep.finrank_hom_simple_simple`) turns disjointness into non-isomorphism, and characters
separate them: on the diagonal matrix `diag(a, 1)`, which lies in `B ⊓ wBw⁻¹`, one takes the value
`α a` and the other the value `β a`, because conjugating by `w` swaps the two diagonal entries.
Conversely, for `α = β` the Borel character is `α ∘ det` (`TauCeti.GL2Borel.linearChar_self`),
which conjugation cannot move, so the two restrictions carry the same action and the criterion
fails.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.mackeyTorusElt`: a diagonal matrix, read as an element of the Mackey subgroup
  at the Weyl element; this is where the two sides of the Mackey condition are compared.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.inv_weyl_mul_torusHom_mul_weyl`: conjugating a diagonal matrix by the Weyl
  element swaps its two entries.
* `TauCeti.GL2Borel.mackeyDisjoint_weyl_iff`: the single Mackey condition, at the Weyl element,
  holds exactly when `α ≠ β`.
* `TauCeti.simple_GL2PrincipalSeries_iff`: **the principal series `Ind_B^{GL₂}(α ⊗ β)` is
  irreducible if and only if `α ≠ β`.**

## Implementation notes

The universe of `F` is pinned to `Type` in the representation-theoretic statements, unlike in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/PrincipalSeries/Basic.lean`, where the principal
series is defined for `F : Type u`. The Mackey criterion `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff` asks for
the coefficient field and the group to lie in the *same* universe, and the coefficient field here
is `ℂ : Type`; pinning `F : Type` is what puts `GL (Fin 2) F` there too. The criterion therefore
covers finite fields presented by a `Type`-valued representative — every finite field has one, up
to a ring isomorphism, namely `GaloisField p n` — but it does not apply *directly* to a finite
field declared in some `Type u` with `u ≠ 0`; such a presentation first has to be transported
along a ring isomorphism with a small model, or wait for the upstream generalization described
next. The purely group-theoretic lemmas about the Weyl conjugation keep both an arbitrary universe
and an arbitrary commutative ring.

That pin is not a choice this file could make differently. The predicate
`TauCeti.MackeyDisjoint` is itself declared for a field and a group in one universe, so the very
statement of the Mackey condition at `ℂ` and `GL (Fin 2) F` needs `F : Type`; and the criterion
that consumes it ends at Mathlib's `FDRep.simple_iff_end_is_rank_one`, which is stated for
`{k : Type u} {G : Type u}`. Relaxing the pin therefore means an upstream generalization of that
Mathlib lemma, not a change here. `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/Steinberg.lean`
records the same obstruction for the companion criterion `FDRep.simple_iff_char_is_norm_one`.

Mackey disjointness is unfolded through `TauCeti.mackeyDisjoint_iff_finrank_eq_zero` and Schur's
lemma rather than by exhibiting intertwiners by hand: both sides of the Mackey condition at `w`
are one-dimensional, so `FDRep.finrank_hom_simple_simple` reduces the condition to the existence
of an isomorphism, and for one-dimensional representations an isomorphism is exactly an equality
of the characters they carry.

The membership `diag(a, 1) ∈ B ⊓ wBw⁻¹` is all that is used of the Mackey subgroup; the file
deliberately does not compute `B ⊓ wBw⁻¹` to be the split torus, because the reducible direction
needs no such description — `α ∘ det` is conjugation-invariant on all of `GL₂`, not only on the
torus.
