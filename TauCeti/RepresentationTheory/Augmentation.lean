# The augmentation subrepresentation of a permutation representation

A permutation representation `k[X]` of a group `G` on a `G`-set `X` always carries two canonical
subrepresentations, visible before anything is known about `G`: the **invariant line** spanned by
the sum of the standard basis, and the **augmentation subrepresentation** cut out by the vanishing
of the sum of the coefficients.  Neither uses more than the fact that `G` permutes the standard
basis, which leaves the coefficient sum unchanged.

For a finite `X` whose cardinality is invertible in `k` the two are complementary, so `k[X]` splits
as a line carrying the trivial representation plus a representation of dimension `|X| - 1`.  That
splitting is recorded as an equivalence of representations
`TauCeti.ofMulActionEquivProdAugmentation`, whose first factor is the trivial representation on `k`
itself: a scalar names the multiple it takes of the sum of the standard basis.  It is the source of
the *deleted* permutation representations, of which the standard representation of the symmetric
group in `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Symmetric.Standard` is the first example.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.permutationSum`: the sum of the standard basis of `k[X]`, for a finite `X`.
* `TauCeti.invariantLine`: the line spanned by `TauCeti.permutationSum`, as a subrepresentation.
* `TauCeti.augmentationSubrepresentation`: the kernel of the augmentation, as a subrepresentation.
* `TauCeti.invariantLineEquivTrivial`: for a nonempty `X` over a domain, the invariant line is the
  trivial representation on `k` itself.
* `TauCeti.ofMulActionEquivProdAugmentation`: when `|X|` is invertible in `k`, the permutation
  representation is the trivial representation plus the augmentation subrepresentation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.sumCoords_basis_ofMulAction`: the augmentation is invariant, which is what makes the
  augmentation subrepresentation a subrepresentation.
* `TauCeti.ofMulAction_permutationSum`: the sum of the standard basis is fixed, which is what makes
  the invariant line one.
* `TauCeti.toRepresentation_invariantLine`: the invariant line carries the trivial representation,
  and `TauCeti.finrank_invariantLine` says it is a line.
* `TauCeti.ker_sumCoords_basis_eq_span`: the augmentation subrepresentation is spanned by the
  differences of the standard basis vectors from a fixed one.
* `TauCeti.isCompl_invariantLine_augmentationSubrepresentation`: when `|X|` is invertible in `k`,
  or `X` is empty, the two subrepresentations are complementary.
* `TauCeti.finrank_augmentationSubrepresentation`: the augmentation subrepresentation has
  dimension `|X| - 1`.
* `TauCeti.character_augmentationSubrepresentation`: for a nonempty `X`, its character is the
  character of `k[X]` less `1`, the trivial quotient contributing that `1`.
* `TauCeti.ofMulActionEquivProdAugmentation_apply_fst` and
  `TauCeti.coe_ofMulActionEquivProdAugmentation_apply_snd`: the two components a vector splits
  into are the average of its coefficients and what subtracting that multiple of the sum of the
  standard basis leaves.

## Implementation notes

The augmentation used here is Mathlib's `Module.Basis.sumCoords` of the standard basis
`MonoidAlgebra.basis X k`, a `k`-linear map on the free module `k[X]` of an arbitrary index type
`X`, because that is what a permutation representation acts on.  Nothing is restated about it:
`TauCeti.MonoidAlgebra.basis_repr` of `TauCeti.Algebra.MonoidAlgebra.Basis` is the bridge from that
basis to `MonoidAlgebra.coeff` that Mathlib does not record, and the generic `Module.Basis` API
computes with the augmentation once it is available.  The augmentation is therefore *not* an
instance
of `TauCeti.MonoidAlgebra.augmentation` of `TauCeti.Algebra.MonoidAlgebra.Exactness`, which is the
ring homomorphism `k[M] →+* k` of a monoid algebra: a `G`-set carries no multiplication, so there
is no ring structure on `k[X]` for a ring homomorphism to be defined on.  On the overlap, `X` a
monoid, the two maps agree, both sending `single x a` to `a`.

Invertibility of `|X|` in `k`, rather than an ordered field or an averaging operator, is what the
splitting needs, and for a nonempty `X` over a nontrivial `k` it is the sharp hypothesis: if
`|X| = 0` in `k` then `permutationSum` is a nonzero element of the augmentation subrepresentation,
so the invariant line meets it and the two are not complementary.  For an empty `X`, or a trivial
`k`, every module in sight is zero and the two are complementary whatever `|X|` is in `k`; the
empty case is the first disjunct of `TauCeti.isCompl_invariantLine_augmentationSubrepresentation`.
The character identity `TauCeti.character_augmentationSubrepresentation` needs no such hypothesis:
the `1` it subtracts is the trace of a rank-one projection onto a line transverse to the
augmentation subrepresentation, and such a line exists whether or not the *invariant* line is one.
