# The line representations of the generalized Kronecker quiver

Put the base field at both vertices of the generalized Kronecker quiver, let one distinguished
arrow act by multiplication by a scalar `c` and every other arrow by the identity. This file
builds that representation, `TauCeti.kroneckerLineRep`. Every member of the family is
indecomposable as soon as its scalar is nonzero or the quiver carries an arrow other than the
distinguished one, and on a quiver carrying such a second arrow the family is pairwise
non-isomorphic:

`kroneckerLineRep k a₁ c ≅ kroneckerLineRep k a₁ d ↔ c = d`.

Every member of the family has dimension vector `(1, 1)`. So on a quiver with at least two arrows
the dimension vector of a finite-dimensional indecomposable **does not determine it**, and its
Tits value is `2 - #arrows`, not `1`. Both facts are sharpness statements: the Gabriel injection
`TauCeti.nonempty_iso_of_dimVector_eq_of_indecomposable_of_isAcyclic` and the real-root property
`TauCeti.titsForm_dimVector_eq_one_of_indecomposable_of_isAcyclic` are proved for an acyclic
quiver whose Tits form is *positive definite*, and the Kronecker quiver -- acyclic, with the
positive semidefinite Tits form `(a - b) ^ 2` of `TauCeti.Quiver.Kronecker.titsForm_apply` --
shows that neither survives the weakening of that hypothesis to acyclicity alone.

The family is the affine chart of the `ℙ¹`-family the Kronecker quiver is known for, and only that
chart: letting the two arrows of `• ⇉ •` act by a pair of scalars `(c₀, c₁)`, rescaling that pair
by a unit produces an isomorphic representation, so the classes are the points `[c₀ : c₁]` of the
projective line. Normalizing the non-distinguished arrows to the identity picks the chart
`c₁ ≠ 0` and parametrizes it by `c = c₀ / c₁`. Neither the one class this omits -- the point at
infinity, where the distinguished arrow acts by the identity and every other arrow by zero -- nor
the exhaustiveness of the resulting list, is built here.

The member at `c = 0` is the smallest Jordan block `TauCeti.kroneckerJordanRep k a₁ 0` of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.FiniteRepType`, up to the identification of
`k[X]/(X)` with `k`. That file settles the representation type of the quiver with the blocks of
every size, which grow in dimension, and records there that the lines below would only settle it
over an infinite base field. The point of the lines is the other one: they are infinitely many
indecomposables *at a single dimension vector* when the field is infinite, and already two of
them over any field at all.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.kroneckerLineRep`: the line `k` at both vertices of the generalized Kronecker quiver,
  the distinguished arrow acting by a scalar and every other arrow by the identity.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.indecomposable_kroneckerLineRep`: a line representation is indecomposable as soon as
  its scalar is nonzero or some arrow other than the distinguished one exists; its endomorphisms
  are recorded faithfully by a single scalar.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_kroneckerLineRep_iso_iff`: **on a quiver carrying an arrow other than the
  distinguished one, two of them are isomorphic exactly when their scalars agree.**
* `TauCeti.dimVector_kroneckerLineRep`: every line representation has dimension vector `1` at
  both vertices.
* `TauCeti.exists_indecomposable_dimVector_eq_not_nonempty_iso`: **on a generalized Kronecker
  quiver with two distinct arrows the dimension vector does not determine an indecomposable**:
  over every field such a quiver carries two non-isomorphic finite-dimensional indecomposables of
  the same dimension vector.
* `TauCeti.titsForm_dimVector_kroneckerLineRep`: the Tits value of that common dimension vector is
  `2 - #arrows`, which is `1` only for the `A₂` quiver.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.kroneckerLineRep` carries `@[expose]`, for the reason
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.Representation` records for
`TauCeti.kroneckerRep`: a functor built by `CategoryTheory.Paths.lift` reveals its value on
objects only through its definition, so without it every statement below reading a component of a
morphism as a linear map on `k` fails to elaborate.

/-! ### Indecomposability and the classification -/

/-- **A line representation is indecomposable as soon as its scalar is nonzero or some arrow other
than the distinguished one exists.** Its endomorphisms are recorded faithfully by their scalar in
the base field, which is a local ring, so its only idempotent endomorphisms are `0` and the
identity.

What forces the two components of an endomorphism to agree is either an arrow other than the
distinguished one, acting as the identity on both, or the invertibility of the distinguished
arrow. The hypothesis is not an artefact: over the `A₂` quiver of a single arrow acting by `c = 0`
nothing relates the two components, and the line is there the direct sum of the two vertex
simples. That quiver has only the three isomorphism classes counted by
`TauCeti.card_skeleton_indecomposable_kronecker`, with no room for a family. -/

invertible scalar, and its naturality along the distinguished arrow then equates the two
scalars. -/

/-- **Two line representations are isomorphic exactly when their scalars agree.** So over an
infinite field the isomorphism classes of indecomposables at the dimension vector `(1, 1)` are
infinite in number, the affine chart of the `ℙ¹` of the Kronecker quiver. -/

/-- **On a generalized Kronecker quiver with two distinct arrows the dimension vector does not
determine an indecomposable.** Over every field such a quiver carries two non-isomorphic
finite-dimensional indecomposable representations with the same dimension vector, the lines at the
scalars `0` and `1`.

This is the sharpness of `TauCeti.nonempty_iso_of_dimVector_eq_of_indecomposable_of_isAcyclic`:
that theorem holds over an acyclic quiver whose Tits form is positive definite, and the Kronecker
quiver is acyclic with a Tits form that is only positive semidefinite. -/

`Ã₁` recorded by `TauCeti.Quiver.Kronecker.titsForm_eq_zero_iff_exists_smul`, and for more arrows
its Tits value `2 - #arrows` is negative. -/
