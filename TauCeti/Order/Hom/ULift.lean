# Range of lifted order homomorphisms

Mathlib's `OrderHom.uliftMap` lifts an order homomorphism `f : α →o β` to
`ULift α →o ULift β`. This file records that its range consists of the lifts of the elements of the
range of `f`. For instance, the coface maps `(SimplexCategory.δ j).toOrderHom.uliftMap` between the
`ULift (Fin _)` index types of simplicial thickenings inherit their range from `Fin.succAbove`.
(Injectivity of the lift is Mathlib's `ULift.map_injective`, since the underlying function of
`f.uliftMap` is `ULift.map f`.)
