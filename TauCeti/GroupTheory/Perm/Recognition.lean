# Recognizing cycles and transpositions in a permutation group

This file supplies recognition steps that read off structure of a permutation group from cycle
data. A transitive subgroup of a finite symmetric group whose degree is prime contains a full
cycle. A permutation with exactly one 2-cycle and all its other cycles of odd length has an odd
power that is a transposition, and the exponent is given explicitly as the product of those odd
lengths.

Both feed the recognition of a full symmetric group, which needs a primitive group containing a
transposition: a transitive group of prime degree is primitive, and a transposition is what the
second result produces. In the Galois-theoretic application the cycle pattern of the element fed
to the second result is the degree pattern of a factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime, read
through the Frobenius element.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_isCycle_mem_of_isPretransitive_of_prime_card`: a transitive permutation group
  of prime degree contains a full cycle.
* `Equiv.Perm.isSwap_pow_prod_erase_two_cycleType_and_odd`: if a permutation has exactly one
  2-cycle and all its other cycles have odd length, an explicit odd power is a transposition.
* `Equiv.Perm.exists_odd_isSwap_pow`: the corresponding existential form.

/-- A transitive permutation group of prime degree contains a full cycle.

The returned permutation has order and support cardinality equal to the degree, so its support
is all of `α`. This is intended as a prime-degree recognition input for the low-degree
classification and for the prime-degree branch of the `Sₙ` realization argument.

/-- If a permutation has exactly one cycle of length two and every other cycle has odd length,
then raising it to the product of those other cycle lengths gives a transposition.

The exponent is itself odd. This is the cycle-theoretic step used to turn a factorization pattern
with one quadratic factor and only odd-degree remaining factors into a transposition in a Galois
group. -/
