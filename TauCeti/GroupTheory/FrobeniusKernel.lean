# The Frobenius kernel and its size

The **Frobenius kernel** of a subgroup `H` of `G` is the identity together with the elements of `G`
lying in no conjugate of `H`,

`frobeniusKernel H = {1} ∪ (G ∖ ⋃_g g H g⁻¹)`.

That union of conjugates is Mathlib's `Group.conjugatesOfSet (H : Set G)`, the set of elements
conjugate to an element of `H`.

Frobenius's theorem says that when `G` is finite and `H` is a Frobenius complement — proper,
nontrivial, and meeting each of its distinct conjugates trivially
(`TauCeti.IsFrobeniusComplement`) — this set is a normal subgroup, and that is not elementary: the
known proofs go through the character theory of `G`. What *is* elementary, and is what this file
proves, is everything about the kernel except its closure under multiplication: it contains the
identity, it is closed under inversion and under conjugation, it meets every conjugate of `H` only
in the identity, and — the counting statement the roadmap records — for a finite `G` it has exactly
`|G : H|` elements.

The count is the inclusion-exclusion that gives Frobenius's theorem its shape, and it is really a
statement about a trivial-intersection *set* `S` for `H` (`TauCeti.IsTISet`): the conjugates
`g S g⁻¹` are pairwise disjoint for distinct cosets `g H` and depend only on the coset, so the
elements they cover are indexed bijectively by the pairs (a coset of `H`, an element of `S`) and
number `|G : H| · |S|`. That is `TauCeti.IsTISet.ncard_conjugatesOfSet`, proved alongside
`TauCeti.IsTISet` itself in `TauCeti/GroupTheory/TrivialIntersection.lean`. The complement of the
kernel is the set of conjugates of the nonidentity elements of `H`, which for a
trivial-intersection subgroup is such a set (`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.isTISet_diff_one`), and the
count specializes to `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.ncard_compl_frobeniusKernel`, the `Set.ncard` identity
`((frobeniusKernel H)ᶜ).ncard = |G : H| · (|H| - 1)`. That identity holds for any `G`, finite or
not, but for an infinite `G` it does not in general represent a count of elements: an infinite side
reads as the junk value `0` that `Set.ncard` and `Subgroup.index` take on infinite arguments. A
degenerate case can of course still be a genuine count — for `H = ⊥` the kernel is everything and
its complement is honestly empty — but nothing outside the finite case says so. For a finite `G`
there are indeed `|G : H| · (|H| - 1)` elements outside the kernel, and the remaining
`|G| - |G : H| · (|H| - 1) = |G : H|` elements are the kernel, and the rest is arithmetic.

Together with normality the count is exactly what makes the kernel a *complement*:
`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.isComplement'_of_coe_eq_frobeniusKernel` says that, for a finite `G`, a
subgroup whose carrier is the Frobenius kernel is automatically a complement to `H`, so once
Frobenius's theorem supplies the subgroup, the semidirect decomposition `G = N ⋊ H` is free.
Nothing here asserts that a subgroup with that carrier exists.

No subgroup hypothesis beyond `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup` is needed for the count once `G` is finite, and
the two degenerate cases are honest instances rather than exclusions:
`frobeniusKernel ⊤ = {1}` has one element and `⊤` has index `1`, while `frobeniusKernel ⊥` is
everything and `⊥` has index `|G|`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.frobeniusKernel`: the identity together with the elements in no conjugate of `H`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_frobeniusKernel`: membership, elementwise.
* `TauCeti.inv_mem_frobeniusKernel_iff` and `TauCeti.conj_mem_frobeniusKernel_iff`: the kernel is
  closed under inversion and invariant under conjugation, for every subgroup `H`.
* `TauCeti.frobeniusKernel_inter_conj_smul_eq_singleton` and
  `TauCeti.frobeniusKernel_inter_eq_singleton`: the kernel meets every conjugate of `H`, and in
  particular `H` itself, exactly in the identity.
* `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.ncard_compl_frobeniusKernel`: the `Set.ncard` identity
  `((frobeniusKernel H)ᶜ).ncard = |G : H| · (|H| - 1)`, which for a finite `G` counts the elements
  *outside* the kernel — the nonidentity elements of the conjugates of `H`, each counted once — and
  for an infinite `G` reads `0 = 0`.
* `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.ncard_frobeniusKernel` and
  `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.natCard_frobeniusKernel`: **for a finite `G` the kernel has `|G : H|`
  elements.**
* `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.isComplement'_of_coe_eq_frobeniusKernel`: for a finite `G`, a subgroup
  whose carrier is the kernel is a complement to `H`.
