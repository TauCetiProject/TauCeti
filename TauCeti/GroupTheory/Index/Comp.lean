# Kernels and cokernels of a composite

For homomorphisms `f : A →* B` and `g : B →* C` of arbitrary groups, this file proves the
cross-multiplied index identity

`[C : gf(A)] · #ker(f) · #ker(g) = [C : g(B)] · [B : f(A)] · #ker(g ∘ f)`,

where `[B : f(A)]` is the cardinality of the coset space `B ⧸ f(A)`. It needs no finiteness
hypothesis: infinite orders and indices are read as `0`, and either both sides are `0` or all six
quantities are finite. The images need not be normal.

When the kernels and indices are finite, write `z(f) = [B : f(A)] / #ker(f)`. Dividing out gives
`z(g ∘ f) = z(g) · z(f)`. For abelian groups the indices are the orders of the cokernels, and this
is the count along the kernel–cokernel exact sequence

`0 → ker f → ker (g ∘ f) → ker g → coker f → coker (g ∘ f) → coker g → 0`.

For an isogeny `φ : E → E'` with dual `φ̂`, the composite `φ̂ ∘ φ` is multiplication by `deg φ`,
so on the points over a field this gives `z([deg φ]) = z(φ̂) · z(φ)` whenever the kernels and
cokernels involved are finite. Ratios of this kind over local fields are the local factors in
Cassels' proof that the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer quotient is an isogeny invariant.

  `AddMonoidHom.index_range_comp_mul_card_ker_mul_card_ker`: the cross-multiplied index identity
  for a composite.
