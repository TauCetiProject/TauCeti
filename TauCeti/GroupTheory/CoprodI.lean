# Isomorphisms of free products of monoids

A family of isomorphisms `M i ≃* N i` induces an isomorphism `CoprodI M ≃* CoprodI N` of the free
products, acting on each factor by the given isomorphism.  This is the indexed counterpart of
Mathlib's `MulEquiv.coprodCongr` for the free product of two monoids.  It is used to rewrite a
free product of fundamental groups one factor at a time, for instance to recognise the
fundamental group of a wedge of circles as a free group.

The free product of a family indexed by a type with a unique element is that single monoid.

## Main declarations

* `MulEquiv.coprodICongr`: the isomorphism of free products induced by a family of isomorphisms.
* `MulEquiv.coprodIUnique`: the free product of a family indexed by a type with a unique element
  is isomorphic to the monoid at the single index.
