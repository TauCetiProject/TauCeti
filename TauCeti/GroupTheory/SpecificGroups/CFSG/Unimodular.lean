# The Lie-type indices whose Dynkin diagram is unimodular

`TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.GeckGroup` gives every valid index a concrete matrix group with numbered
root subgroups and a Frobenius. That carrier is built from the adjoint representation, so the
characters occurring in it generate the root lattice and not, in general, the whole character
lattice of the pinned torus: it is expected to be the adjoint form of a Chevalley--Demazure group,
whereas the CFSG recipe has to be run in the simply connected form. The lattice condition that
separates the two forms -- that the weights span the whole character lattice -- holds by
`TauCeti.DynkinType.span_range_geckWeight_eq_top_iff` exactly in the types `E₈`, `F₄` and `G₂`.

This file proves that span, and the closed immersion of the weight torus it buys, for
`TauCeti.UnimodularLieIndex`, the valid indices whose underlying diagram is one of those three.
Six of the seventeen Lie-type constructors qualify, and they are of two kinds:

```text
E₈(q),  F₄(q),  G₂(q),        ²G₂(3^(2m+1)),  ²F₄(2^(2m+1)),  ²F₄(2)'.
```

The three on the left are untwisted, and their Steinberg map is the `q`-power Frobenius
`TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.geckFrobenius`; they are collected as
`TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex` and carried through the rest of the recipe here. The three on
the right take an odd power of a half-Frobenius instead, so their Steinberg map is not built in
this file.

The predicate `TauCeti.LieTypeIndex.HasUnimodularDiagram` is about the diagram alone, so it says
nothing about which Steinberg map an index takes. That is what makes it the right hypothesis here:
`²F₄(2^(2m+1))` and `²F₄(2)'` have the same character lattice as `F₄(q)`, and `²G₂(3^(2m+1))` the
same as `G₂(q)`, whatever endomorphism is later taken of their common carrier. The Suzuki family
`²B₂(2^(2m+1))` does *not* appear: its underlying diagram is `B₂`, whose Cartan matrix has
determinant two, so the Geck carrier is not its simply connected form.

Identifying the carrier itself with the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group, and
proving it reductive, is the Layer 9 work of `TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md` that this
roadmap consumes rather than performs; no declaration below asserts either, nor that a constructed
group is finite, perfect, or simple.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex`: the unimodular indices whose Steinberg map is not a
  half-Frobenius power, that is `E₈(q)`, `F₄(q)` and `G₂(q)`, with
  `TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg` their Steinberg map and
  `TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.Group` the candidate simple group, the derived subgroup of
  the fixed points of that map modulo the centre of that derived subgroup.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.UnimodularLieIndex.span_range_geckWeight_eq_top`: the Geck weights of an index with
  unimodular diagram span the whole character lattice, the lattice condition the simply connected
  form requires.
* `TauCeti.UnimodularLieIndex.isClosedImmersion_geckWeightTorus`: consequently the pinned split
  torus is a closed subgroup scheme of the Geck carrier.
* `TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg_geckRootSubgroup` and
  `TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.steinberg_geckWeightTorus`: the Steinberg map raises the
  parameter of every numbered root subgroup, and every coordinate of a weight-torus point, to the
  `q`-th power, which is how the Steinberg map of an untwisted index acts on both halves of the
  pinned data of this carrier.
* `TauCeti.UnimodularExceptionalIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_steinberg_iff`: the fixed points of that
  map are the points of the carrier whose matrix entries lie in the field of definition `𝔽_q`
  recorded by `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.fixedField`.

## Roadmap

Milestone L0 of `TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md` asks for the points of the pinned simply
connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme of `TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum`, with
its root subgroups. **This file does not close L0 on any branch, and the Geck carrier is not
offered as its carrier.** The pinned Chevalley--Demazure group, its root datum and its pinning are
a Layer 9 target of `TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md` that the CFSG roadmap consumes
rather than builds. The full character span proved here is the lattice hypothesis that
identification needs, so it is a prerequisite of L0 and not a substitute for it.

Against the Geck carrier, `steinberg` is the map `Frob_q` and `Group` the composite
`[H_d, H_d] / Z([H_d, H_d])` on the three untwisted branches, so the equations that milestones L1
and L3 ask for are proved here in the shape they will be needed; they transfer to the L0 carrier
along the Layer 9 identification, and not before. What the `²G₂`, `²F₄` and Tits branches lack in
addition is their Steinberg map: it is an odd power of the special isogeny `τ` of milestone L2, and
`τ` is a Layer 9 target as well. The relation `τ ^ 2 = Frob_p` that L2 records will be read against
`TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.geckFrobenius`.

is the lattice condition that separates the simply connected form of a Chevalley--Demazure group

of the results here. It is a statement about characters only: that the carrier is reductive, and
that it is the pinned simply connected group of `TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum`, are
Layer 9 statements that this file consumes when they arrive rather than proving. -/
