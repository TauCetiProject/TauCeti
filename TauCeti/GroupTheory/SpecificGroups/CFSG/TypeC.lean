# The untwisted family `Cₙ(q)` on the standard symplectic carrier

The type-`C` branch of the classification list is built on the type-`C` diagram of rank `n`, and
Tau Ceti's explicit full-weight Chevalley carrier for that diagram is `TauCeti.SpStd.groupScheme`,
the Kostant toral closure of the standard representation of `sp_(2n)` inside `GL_(2n)` over `ℤ`.
This file attaches that carrier to a validated type-`C` index: the group of algebraic-closure-valued
points of the carrier at the index's rank, its Bourbaki-numbered simple root subgroups, and the
reading of their root characters in the type-`C` root datum the index names. It then runs on that
group the fixed-point recipe of the classification list,

```text
H_d = fixedSubgroup d.steinberg,        d.Group = [H_d, H_d] / Z([H_d, H_d]),
```

whose Steinberg endomorphism `d.steinberg` is the `q`-power Frobenius, the family `Cₙ(q)` being
untwisted. That endomorphism raises every matrix entry to the `q`-th power, so it satisfies the
pinned equation `Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q)` on the numbered simple-root subgroups, and the group
`H_d` it fixes is the group of carrier points whose entries lie in the copy `𝔽_q` of the field of
`q` elements inside the algebraic closure.

The carrier is indexed by `n` in the spelling `C (n + 1)`, so a validated index of rank `r` uses
the carrier at `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank`, which is `r - 1`. That subtraction is harmless
because `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.three_le_rank` bounds the rank below by three:
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one` recovers `r`, and every numbered object below is indexed
by `Fin d.1.rank`, the upstream Bourbaki index type of the index's own Dynkin type, rather than by a
node of the carrier. The two numberings agree node for node, so
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierNode` is the rank identification and nothing more; that is what
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_carrierNode_eq_root_simpleIndex` records, reading the
character of the `i`-th raising subgroup as the `i`-th simple root of the type-`C` root datum the
index names.

The rank-two member of the same carrier family is *not* reached from here. `TauCeti.DynkinType.C 2`
is not a valid Dynkin type, the rank-two root system being carried by `B 2`, and correspondingly a
validated type-`C` index has rank at least three. The rank-two carrier serves the Suzuki family
instead, in `TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeB2.lean`, where the node correspondence
acquires the swap of the two Bourbaki nodes.

Nothing here asserts that the carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, that it is
the symplectic group scheme or the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme of type
`Cₙ`, or that its point group is finite. Nor is anything asserted of the quotient: it is not proved
finite, perfect, simple, or isomorphic to `PSp_(2n)(q)`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.AmbientGroup`: the algebraic-closure-valued points of the standard
  symplectic carrier at the index's rank.

  Bourbaki-numbered node, with
  `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_carrierNode_eq_root_simpleIndex` identifying the
  character of that subgroup with the corresponding simple root of the type-`C` root datum.
* `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.steinberg`: the `q`-power Frobenius endomorphism of that group, with

/-! ## The carrier rank and the node correspondence -/

/-- **The rank parameter of the standard symplectic carrier serving a validated type-`C` index.**
`TauCeti.SpStd.groupScheme n` is the carrier of type `C (n + 1)`, so the carrier serving an index
of rank `r` is the one at `r - 1`. The subtraction never truncates, `r` being at least three by
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.three_le_rank`; `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one` is the
identification that recovers `r`. -/
def carrierRank : ℕ := d.1.rank - 1

/-- The carrier rank of a validated type-`C` index is one less than its rank. It is oriented
towards `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.rank`, so that `simp` normalizes the successor of the carrier
rank to the rank the index's own Bourbaki index type is built on. -/

  have := d.three_le_rank
  -- The body is unexposed, so the subtraction has to be unfolded before `omega` sees it.
  rw [carrierRank]
  omega

/-- **The carrier node numbered by a Bourbaki node of the index's diagram.** Unlike the rank-two
correspondence of the Suzuki family, this is the rank identification and nothing else: the standard
symplectic carrier at `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank` numbers its generators by the Bourbaki
numbering of the type-`C` diagram that the index names, node for node. -/
abbrev carrierNode (i : Fin d.1.rank) : Fin (d.carrierRank + 1) :=
  Fin.cast d.carrierRank_add_one.symm i

/-- **The node correspondence transports the type-`C` Cartan matrix.** The entry at a pair of
carrier nodes is the entry at the pair of Bourbaki nodes they number: `carrierNode` moves no node
value, only the rank its index type is built on, and `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one`
identifies the two ranks. -/

/-! ## The ambient group and its simple root subgroups -/

/-- **The ambient group this file attaches to a validated type-`C` index**: the points of the
explicit full-weight standard symplectic Chevalley carrier at the index's rank, over the algebraic
closure of its prime field. No finiteness, reductivity, pinning or maximality statement is attached
to it, and it is not claimed to be the points of the pinned simply connected group scheme of type
`Cₙ`, no identification of the two carriers being proved. -/
abbrev AmbientGroup : Type := SpStd.points d.carrierRank d.1.Closure

/-- The positive simple-root subgroup at the Bourbaki-numbered node `i` of the type-`C` diagram. It
is the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the node that `carrierNode` names. -/
def simpleRootSubgroup (i : Fin d.1.rank) :

/-- **The simple-root subgroups sit at the simple roots of the type-`C` root datum.** The character
by which the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter of `simpleRootSubgroup i`, read in the
same node correspondence, is the `i`-th simple root of
`TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at the Dynkin type the index names. This is the sense
in which the standard symplectic carrier serves that diagram; it is not a claim that the carrier is
the pinned group of the diagram, no pinning being constructed for it. -/

  -- which is the same route the upstream identification takes past the dependent root index. The
  -- two index transports that remain are then the stated equations `cartanMatrix_C_carrierNode`
  -- and `dynkinType_cartanMatrix_apply`, so no dependent conversion is left to the elaborator.

/-! ## The Steinberg endomorphism -/

/-- **The Steinberg endomorphism of a validated type-`C` index**, formed on the standard symplectic
carrier: the `q`-power Frobenius of the ambient group, `q` being the field order the index records.
The family `Cₙ(q)` is untwisted, so no diagram automorphism and no half-Frobenius enters;
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.diagramPerm_eq_one` is the check that its diagram permutation is trivial.

It is the Steinberg map of `Cₙ(q)` on the pinned carrier described in the module docstring only
along the identification of the two carriers recorded there, and not before. -/

  SpStd.frobenius d.carrierRank d.1.characteristic d.1.fieldExponent d.1.Closure

/-- The Steinberg map of a type-`C` index is the carrier's Frobenius at the exponent the index
records. This is its unfolding lemma; the definition itself stays sealed.

It is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: `steinberg_simpleRootSubgroup` and `coe_steinberg_apply` are
the normal forms the pinned equations of this file are stated against, and unfolding to
`TauCeti.SpStd.frobenius` would keep them from firing. -/
theorem steinberg_def :

/-- The Steinberg map acts on the ambient group by raising every matrix entry to the `q`-th power.

The matrices are indexed by the carrier's own `Fin ((n + 1) + (n + 1))` at `n` the carrier rank,
which is `2 * d.1.rank` under `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one`. -/

/-! ## The fixed points and the classification candidate -/

/-- **A point of the ambient group is fixed by the Steinberg map exactly when all of its matrix
entries lie in the field of definition.** Writing `𝔽_q` for `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.fixedField`,
the copy of the field of `q` elements inside the algebraic closure, the group `H_d` that the
fixed-point recipe is run on below is therefore the group of points of the standard symplectic
carrier whose entries lie in `𝔽_q`.

As for `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_geckFrobenius_iff`, this is not a `simp` lemma:
`TauCeti.fixedSubgroup` is `MonoidHom.eqLocus` against the identity, so `simp` rewrites its
left-hand side to `d.steinberg g = g` through `MonoidHom.mem_eqLocus`, and the `simpNF` linter
rejects the annotation. -/

fixed points of its Steinberg map, modulo the centre of that derived subgroup.

This is the fixed-point recipe of the classification list on the `C` branch, run on the standard
symplectic carrier. Nothing asserts that it is finite, perfect, or simple, nor that the carrier is
the pinned one the module docstring describes. -/
