# Fixed fields and fixing subgroups

Two complements to Mathlib's Galois correspondence.

For a finite Galois extension `M / K`, a subgroup `H ≤ Gal(M/K)` and an intermediate field `E`,
the fixed field of `H` and `E` generate `M` exactly when `H` meets the fixers of `E` trivially.

The correspondence between subgroups and their fixed fields also holds with no hypothesis on
`M / K` at all, provided the subgroup is finite: Artin's theorem makes `M` finite Galois over the
fixed field of a finite `H`, and the fixers of that field are then exactly `H`. This is how a
subgroup of the automorphism group of an infinite extension is recovered from the field it cuts
out; the fixing subgroup of a subfield of finite degree is finite for the same reason.

/-- **A trivial meet of subgroups is a full join of fields.** `M ^ H` and `E` generate `M` exactly
when `H ⊓ Gal(M/E)` is trivial.

This is the Galois correspondence read in both directions: `fixingSubgroup` turns a join of fields
into a meet of subgroups, and `fixedField` turns the trivial subgroup back into `⊤`.

Stated in the `Subgroup` namespace rather than `IntermediateField`, so that `H` — the first
explicit argument, and the one `fixedField` is applied to — carries the dot notation: a consumer
writes `H.fixedField_sup_eq_top_iff E`. -/

/-- **A finite group of automorphisms is the whole fixing subgroup of its fixed field.** Every
`K`-automorphism of `M` that fixes `M ^ H` pointwise already lies in `H`.

Mathlib's `IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup_fixedField` is the same conclusion under
`[FiniteDimensional K M]`, which is the stronger hypothesis: a finite-dimensional `M / K` has a
finite automorphism group, so every subgroup of it is finite. Finiteness of `H` is what an
infinite extension `M / K` can still supply. -/
