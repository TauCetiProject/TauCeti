# Scalar towers one step below an intermediate field

Mathlib's `IntermediateField.isScalarTower_mid` supplies `IsScalarTower K E L` for an intermediate
field `E` of `L / K`.  The same statement holds one step further down: any commutative semiring
acting compatibly below `K` also acts compatibly through `E`.

## Main results

* `IntermediateField.instIsScalarTower`: `IsScalarTower k E L` for an intermediate field
  `E` of `L / K` and a base `k` below `K`.

intermediate field `E` of `L / K`; this is the same statement for a base `k` sitting below `K`,
which is what an object of `L` defined over `k` needs in order to be restricted to `E`. -/
