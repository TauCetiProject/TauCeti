# The constant field of an algebraic function field

The *field of constants* of an algebraic function field `F / k` is the relative algebraic closure
`algebraicClosure k F` of `k` in `F`: the elements of `F` that are algebraic over `k`. This file
proves that it is a finite extension of `k`, records the dictionary for the hypothesis that it is
no larger than `k` (the literature's "`k` is the full field of constants"), and shows that
replacing `k` by the field of constants normalizes any function field to one whose field of
constants is exact.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_of_isAlgebraic`: an intermediate extension of a
  function field `F / k` which is algebraic over `k` is finite over `k`.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_algebraicClosure`: the field of constants of a
  function field is finite over the base field.
* `TauCeti.algebraicClosure_eq_bot_iff_isIntegrallyClosedIn`,
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_iff_forall_isAlgebraic`,
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_iff_finrank_algebraicClosure_eq_one`: the three faces of the
  exactness hypothesis on the field of constants.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.algebraicClosure` and
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_algebraicClosure`: `F` is a function field over its field of
  constants, and there the field of constants is exact; the two are packaged as
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.exists_intermediateField_isIntegrallyClosedIn`.
* `TauCeti.algebraicClosure_ratFunc`: `k` is the field of constants of `k(x)`.

/-! ### Exactness of the field of constants -/

/-- `k` is integrally closed in `F` exactly when no element of `F` outside `k` is algebraic over
`k`, that is, when the field of constants of `F / k` is `k` itself. -/

    IntermediateField.toSubalgebra_inj]

/-- The elementwise form of the exactness hypothesis on the field of constants: every element of
`F` algebraic over `k` is already a constant. This is the field-extension reading of Mathlib's
`isIntegrallyClosedIn_iff`, whose injectivity clause is automatic here. -/

/-! ### The normalization device -/

/-- An algebraic function field is a function field over its own field of constants, and by
`TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_algebraicClosure` the field of constants is exact there.

This is the device that lets a statement needing an exact field of constants be applied to an
arbitrary function field. -/

/-- The normalization device: every algebraic function field is, over a finite extension of its
base field, an algebraic function field with an exact field of constants. Results stated under
the exactness hypothesis can therefore be applied to a general function field through this. -/
