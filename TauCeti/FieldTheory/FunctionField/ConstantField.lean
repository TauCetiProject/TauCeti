# The constant field of an algebraic function field

The *field of constants* of an algebraic function field `F / k` is the relative algebraic closure
`algebraicClosure k F` of `k` in `F`: the elements of `F` that are algebraic over `k`. This file
proves that it is a finite extension of `k`, records the dictionary for the hypothesis that it is
no larger than `k` (the literature's "`k` is the full field of constants"), and shows that
replacing `k` by the field of constants normalizes any function field to one whose field of
constants is exact.

It then identifies the constant fields along a change of base.  An intermediate field `k'` of
`F / k` is again a legitimate base field exactly when it is algebraic over `k`, and it is then
automatically finite over `k`; if moreover `k'` is its own field of constants, it *is* the field
of constants of `F / k`.  Specialized to the standing tower of an extension `F' / k'` of `F / k`
with `F' / F` finite, this says that the extension of constant fields `k' / k` is finite — a
theorem, not a hypothesis, and the finiteness that makes the factor `[k' : k]` in the conorm
degree identity and in the Hurwitz genus formula meaningful.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_of_isAlgebraic`: an intermediate extension of a
  function field `F / k` which is algebraic over `k` is finite over `k`.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_algebraicClosure`: the field of constants of a
  function field is finite over the base field.
* `TauCeti.algebraicClosure_eq_bot_iff_isIntegrallyClosedIn`,
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_iff_forall_isAlgebraic`,
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_iff_finrank_algebraicClosure_eq_one`: the three faces of the
  exactness hypothesis on the field of constants.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.algebraicClosure` and
  `TauCeti.isIntegrallyClosedIn_algebraicClosure`: `F` is a function field over its field of
  constants, and there the field of constants is exact; the two are packaged as
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.exists_intermediateField_isIntegrallyClosedIn`.
* `TauCeti.isFunctionField_base_iff_isAlgebraic`, with its two directions
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.isAlgebraic_base` and `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.of_isAlgebraic`: an
  intermediate field of `F / k` is a base field for `F` exactly when it is algebraic over `k`;
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.of_finiteDimensional` lowers the base field again.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_base` and
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.algebraicClosure_eq_restrictScalars_bot`: such an intermediate base
  field is finite over `k`, and is the field of constants of `F / k` as soon as it is its own.
* `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.finiteDimensional_constantExtension`: in an extension `F' / k'` of
  `F / k` with `F' / F` finite, `k' / k` is a finite extension (Stichtenoth, Definition 3.1.1);
  `TauCeti.IsFunctionField.isAlgebraic_algebraMap_iff_isAlgebraic` identifies the fields of
  constants
  along `F ⊆ F'`.
* `TauCeti.algebraicClosure_ratFunc`: `k` is the field of constants of `k(x)`.
