# The fundamental identity at an arbitrary place

Let `F' / k'` be an extension of the field extension `F / k` in which `F' / F` is finite and
separable; of the constant fields only integrality of `k' / k` is asked.  This file proves
**the fundamental identity**

`∑_{P' ∣ P} e(P' ∣ P) · f(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]`

at **every** place `P` of `F / k`, upgrading the inequality of
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Extension/Fibre.lean` and removing the restriction of
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/AffineModel/Extension.lean` to the places of a chosen finite
chart.

The affine model used is the smallest one that sees `P`: its own valuation ring `𝒪_P`, which is a
discrete valuation ring with fraction field `F`, together with the integral closure of `𝒪_P` in
`F'`.  Separability of `F' / F` enters exactly once, to make that integral closure a finite
`𝒪_P`-module — the hypothesis of Mathlib's `Ideal.sum_ramification_inertia_eq_finrank`, which the
affine-model reconciliation consumes.  No separability-free finiteness of a normalization is
available, so the unconditional form of Stichtenoth's Theorem 3.1.11 waits on one.

That local model is the one set up in
`TauCeti/FieldTheory/FunctionField/Place/Extension/Basic.lean`; the action of `𝒪_P` on `F'`
and the scalar tower it sits in are not global instances, so they are reinstalled here.

## Main result

* `TauCeti.Place.sum_ramificationIdx_mul_relativeDegree_eq_finrank_of_isSeparable`: the
  fundamental identity at an arbitrary place, for a separable extension (Stichtenoth,
  Theorem 3.1.11).

/-- **The fundamental identity** (Stichtenoth, Theorem 3.1.11) at an arbitrary place `P` of
`F / k`, for an extension `F' / k'` whose extension of function fields `F' / F` is finite and
**separable**: the ramification indices and relative degrees of the places of `F' / k'` lying
over `P` satisfy `∑_{P' ∣ P} e(P' ∣ P) · f(P' ∣ P) = [F' : F]`.

The finite set `s` is the fibre of `TauCeti.Place.restrict` over `P`, which is finite by
`TauCeti.Place.finite_setOf_restrict_eq`.

Separability is the hypothesis of Mathlib's finiteness theorem for integral closures, and is used
only there; the identity itself holds for every finite extension. -/
