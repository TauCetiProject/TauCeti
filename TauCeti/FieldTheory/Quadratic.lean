# The trace and the norm of a quadratic irrationality

An element `x` of a degree-`2` extension `E/F` that does not lie in `F` satisfies a monic quadratic
`x² = t x - d` over `F`, and the pair `(1, x)` is then an `F`-basis of `E`. In that basis
multiplication by `x` **is** the companion matrix `TauCeti.companionFinTwo t d` of `X² - t X + d`,
which is the reading of the companion matrix its own docstring advertises. Since the trace and the
norm of `x` are the trace and the determinant of that matrix, and both are basis independent,
`Tr_{E/F} x = t` and `N_{E/F} x = d`.

These are what pin the elliptic normal form of `GL₂` in
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/NormalForm.lean`, where the quadratic is the
characteristic polynomial of a matrix and `x` is the eigenvalue it acquires in `E`.

Over a *finite* base field such an `x` always exists as soon as the quadratic has no root in `F`:
the quadratic is then irreducible, so `AdjoinRoot` of it is a degree-`2` extension of `F`, and any
two extensions of a finite field of the same degree are isomorphic
(`FiniteField.algEquivExtension`), so every degree-`2` extension already contains a root.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Algebra.trace_eq_of_mul_self_eq` and `TauCeti.Algebra.norm_eq_of_mul_self_eq`: the trace
  and the norm of an element `x` of a degree-`2` extension satisfying `x² = t x - d`, and lying
  outside the base field, are `t` and `d`.
* `TauCeti.exists_mul_self_eq_of_finite`: over a finite field, a quadratic with no root in `F` has
  a root in every degree-`2` extension.
