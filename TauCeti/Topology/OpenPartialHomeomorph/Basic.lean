# Basic properties of open partial homeomorphisms

This file collects elementary topological facts about open partial homeomorphisms that are not
in Mathlib.

A chart of a manifold is an open partial homeomorphism `φ : M → E`, and subsets of `M` are often
built by pulling back sets from the model space, as `φ.symm '' K` for some `K ⊆ φ.target`. When
`K` is compact and `M` is Hausdorff, such a pulled-back set is closed in all of `M`, not just in
`φ.source`. This lets arguments that need closed subsets of `M` (for instance, the relative
Mayer–Vietoris sequence for the local homology groups `Hₖ(M, M ∖ A)`, whose complements must be
open) be applied to compact convex pieces of a chart.

## Main statements

* `OpenPartialHomeomorph.isClosed_image_symm_of_isCompact`: the inverse of an open partial
  homeomorphism from a Hausdorff space maps compact subsets of its target to closed sets.
