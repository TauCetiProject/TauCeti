# The initial topological space is empty

The initial object of `TopCat` is empty, through Mathlib's isomorphism `TopCat.initialIsoPEmpty`.
As an instance, this makes the separation properties of the empty space, such as being Hausdorff,
available for it by instance search. It is the base of every CW complex in Mathlib's categorical
sense, `TopCat.CWComplex X`, which is a relative CW complex over the map out of `⊥_ TopCat`.
