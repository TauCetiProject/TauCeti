# Composition in alternating-bundle coordinates

Precomposing a fibrewise alternating map with a fibrewise linear map commutes with passing
into bundle coordinates wherever the intermediate trivialization is valid. This identity
allows regularity of pullbacks to be checked on fixed model fibres, without choosing norms
on the original fibres.

In degree one, the identification `ContinuousAlternatingMap.ofSubsingleton` of linear maps with
alternating maps of one variable also commutes with passing into coordinates, with no base-set
hypothesis. This compares regularity of degree-one forms with regularity of sections of the
bundle of fibrewise linear maps.

The coordinate maps are Mathlib's `ContinuousAlternatingMap.inCoordinates` and
`ContinuousLinearMap.inCoordinates`.
