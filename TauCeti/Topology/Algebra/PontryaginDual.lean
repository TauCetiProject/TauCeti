# Topology of Pontryagin duals

The Pontryagin dual of a second-countable locally compact monoid is Polish. For locally compact
abelian groups this ensures that finite Borel measures on the dual are tight and determined by
their Fourier–Stieltjes transforms.

A continuous character of the discrete group `ℤ` is determined by its value at `1`, which may be
any point of the unit circle. This file packages that correspondence as an isomorphism of
topological groups between the unit circle and the Pontryagin dual of `ℤ`. It lets statements
about the dual of `ℤ`, such as Fourier–Stieltjes transforms of measures on it, be read on the
concrete unit circle, where a character becomes the monomial `z ↦ zⁿ`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.circleEquivPontryaginDualInt`: the point `z` of the unit circle corresponds to the
  character `n ↦ zⁿ` of `ℤ`.

## References

* W. Rudin, *Fourier Analysis on Groups*, Interscience (1962), §1.2 (the dual group).
