# Topological group and compactness instances on open subgroups

An open subgroup `U : OpenSubgroup G` carries a `Group` structure through `SubgroupClass` and the
subspace topology through `SetLike.coe`, but instance search does not unfold `↥U` to
`↥U.toSubgroup`. Consequently Mathlib's `Subgroup` instances for topological groups do not fire
directly on `U : OpenSubgroup G`, nor does the open-subset theorem `IsOpen.locallyCompactSpace`.

This file registers those instances directly on `OpenSubgroup G` (and `OpenAddSubgroup G`):
separate and joint continuity of multiplication, continuity of inversion, `IsTopologicalGroup`,
`LocallyCompactSpace` (using openness alone), and `WeaklyLocallyCompactSpace` and `CompactSpace`
(using that an open subgroup of a topological group with separately continuous multiplication is
also closed).

## Main instances

* `OpenSubgroup.instSeparatelyContinuousMul`, `OpenSubgroup.instContinuousMul`,
  `OpenSubgroup.instContinuousInv`, `OpenSubgroup.instIsTopologicalGroup`: topological group
  operations on an open subgroup, with additive versions on `OpenAddSubgroup`.
* `OpenSubgroup.instLocallyCompactSpace`, `OpenSubgroup.instWeaklyLocallyCompactSpace`,
  `OpenSubgroup.instCompactSpace`: local compactness and compactness inherited from the ambient
  group, with additive versions on `OpenAddSubgroup`.
