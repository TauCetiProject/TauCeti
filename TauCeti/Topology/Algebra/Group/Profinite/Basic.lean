# Profinite groups: quotients by normal subgroups, and open subgroups

The foundational layer for profinite groups in the unbundled classes: `G` is a group with a
topology making it a topological group, compact and totally disconnected. The separation chain
itself needs no new work — Mathlib derives `T1Space`, `T2Space` and `T3Space` on such a `G` from
`TotallyDisconnectedSpace.t1Space` and `IsTopologicalGroup.regularSpace` — so no statement of
the profinite and pro-`p` development has to carry a `[T2Space G]` hypothesis.

What is genuinely missing is total disconnectedness of a quotient by a *closed* normal
subgroup. We prove it through the clopen-image argument: the quotient map sends the open
normal subgroups of `G` to clopen neighbourhoods of the identity in `G ⧸ N`, their
intersection is the image of `N`, and in a compact Hausdorff group the connected component of
the identity is the intersection of its clopen neighbourhoods. With the compactness,
topological-group and separation instances, `G ⧸ N` is then a profinite group again.

Closedness of `N` is needed only for the total-disconnectedness results: a quotient by a
non-closed subgroup is not even `T1` (take `ℤ̂ ⧸ ℤ` with `ℤ` dense), so
`QuotientGroup.connectedComponent_one` and `QuotientGroup.instTotallyDisconnectedSpace`
carry the hypothesis, while the clopen-image statement is valid for an arbitrary normal subgroup.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.eq_iInf_sup_openNormalSubgroup`: a closed subgroup is the infimum of the
  subgroups `N ⊔ U` with `U` open normal.
* `QuotientGroup.connectedComponent_one`, `QuotientGroup.instTotallyDisconnectedSpace`:
  the quotient of a profinite group by a closed normal subgroup is totally disconnected.
* `Subgroup.iInf_openNormalSubgroup_eq_bot`: the infimum of the open normal subgroups of a
  profinite group is trivial.
