# Topological facts about the space of matrices

Mathlib gives `Matrix m n α` the product topology of `m → n → α`, so for finite index types it is
pseudo-metrizable whenever `α` is. This makes metrizable-codomain results, such as measurability
of pointwise limits of measurable maps, available for matrix-valued functions without choosing a
matrix norm.

Over a topological field, the inverse of a matrix-valued function that is continuous at a point
with invertible value is continuous there (`ContinuousAt.matrix_inv`), and so are its entries
(`ContinuousAt.matrix_inv_apply`).
