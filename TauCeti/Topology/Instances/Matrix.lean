# Topological properties of matrices

Mathlib gives `Matrix m n α` the product topology of `m → n → α`, so for finite index types it is
pseudo-metrizable whenever `α` is. This makes metrizable-codomain results, such as measurability
of pointwise limits of measurable maps, available for matrix-valued functions without choosing a
matrix norm.

The Kronecker product of two continuously varying matrices is continuous in the product topology.
