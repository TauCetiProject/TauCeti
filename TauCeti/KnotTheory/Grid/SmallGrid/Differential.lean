# The fully blocked grid differential on grids of size at most two

This file records the first small-grid computation for the fully blocked grid differential.
An oriented rectangle needs two distinct side columns, so grids of size at most one have no
rectangles at all. On a `2 × 2` grid, an oriented rectangle covers a single square, and the
four markings of the diagram occupy all four squares — two `O` markings and two `X` markings
on the two diagonals — so every oriented rectangle contains a marking and no rectangle is
fully blocked. In either case every fully blocked count vanishes, hence so does the whole
differential.

The cases `n = 0` and `n = 1` already follow from the column-swap support bound. The new content
here is the size-two computation, which is the first sanity check for the marking-avoidance
condition defining the fully blocked grid complex: on the `2 × 2` unknot grid every square is
marked, so the fully blocked theory sees no rectangles at all.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangles_eq_empty_of_le_two`: no rectangle is fully
  blocked in grid size at most two.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_eq_zero_of_le_two`: every fully blocked
  rectangle coefficient vanishes in grid size at most two.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_eq_zero_of_le_two`: the fully blocked
  differential is the zero linear map in grid size at most two.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_eq_zero_of_two`: the explicit `2 × 2` form.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for
`TauCetiRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane G.3, "The complexes and `∂² = 0`",
and for the standing convention that the grid complexes compute on explicit small grids. The
rectangle-count convention follows Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and
Links*, Chapter 3; the fully blocked marking-avoidance condition follows Definition 4.1.1 and
Chapter 4.6.

/-- In grid size at most two, no oriented rectangle is fully blocked. A rectangle needs two
distinct side columns and two distinct side rows, so it covers exactly the one square at its
initial corner; that square holds a point of the source state, and in a column of only two
squares the two distinct markings of that column leave no unmarked square for it. -/
