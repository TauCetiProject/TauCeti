# Conditional law of a contractable coordinate given the tail

For a contractable process `X`, the conditional law of a coordinate `X j` given the future is the
same as that of any other coordinate `X k`. Two results, both consumed by the de Finetti
directing-measure construction:

* `Contractable.condExp_indicator_future_eq` — for heads `j, k` below a cutoff `r`, the conditional
  expectations of `𝟙_B ∘ X j` and `𝟙_B ∘ X k` given the future σ-algebra `tailFamily X r` agree a.e.
* `Contractable.condExp_indicator_tailProcess_eq` — for arbitrary coordinates `j, k`, the same
  equality conditioning on the process tail σ-algebra `tailProcess X`. The "extreme members agree on
  the tail" step.
