# Laws of maps out of a Dirac measure

A map has almost no freedom on a Dirac measure: since `Measure.dirac x` sees only the point `x`,
the law of `T` under `Measure.dirac x` is the Dirac measure at `T x`, and nothing else. This file
records that in the language of `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw`, whose a.e.-measurability hypothesis is
exactly what `Measure.map_dirac_of_aemeasurable` asks for.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.hasLaw_dirac_source_iff` — an a.e. measurable map has law `ν` under
  `Measure.dirac x` exactly when `ν` is the Dirac measure at its value at `x`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.not_hasLaw_dirac_source_of_forall_ne_dirac` — no map at all has a
  non-Dirac law under a Dirac measure.

Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.hasLaw_dirac_iff` is the statement for a Dirac *target*; the results
here are about a Dirac *source*, which is what `dirac_source` records in their names.

/-- An a.e. measurable map transports a Dirac measure exactly onto the Dirac measure at its
value. The a.e. measurability is exactly what `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw` already asks for. -/
theorem hasLaw_dirac_source_iff {x : X} (hT : AEMeasurable T (Measure.dirac x)) :
    HasLaw T ν (Measure.dirac x) ↔ ν = Measure.dirac (T x) := by
  refine ⟨fun h ↦ ?_, fun h ↦ ⟨hT, ?_⟩⟩
  · rw [← h.map_eq, Measure.map_dirac_of_aemeasurable hT]
  · rw [Measure.map_dirac_of_aemeasurable hT, h]

/-- **A Dirac source admits no non-Dirac law.** No map at all pushes a Dirac measure onto a
measure that is not itself a Dirac measure: a map carries its own a.e. measurability along with
the law it is claimed to have. -/

    ¬HasLaw T ν (Measure.dirac x) :=
