# Operations on the base of a composition-product

Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd` records how `μ ⊗ₘ κ` reacts to operations on the
kernel, but not what happens when the *base* measure is pushed forward. In general nothing does:
`(μ ⊗ₘ κ).map (Prod.map f id)` cannot be read off `μ.map f`, because `κ` still sees the finer
information carried by the points of the source. It can when `κ` itself factors through `f`, and
that case is the main content of this file. It is the base-side counterpart of Mathlib's
`MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd_map`, which pushes the kernel side forward instead.

Restricting the base, by contrast, always commutes with the composition-product.

## Main statements

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_prodMap_compProd_comap` — for `f : W → Y` measurable and
  `κ : Kernel Y Z`, `(μ ⊗ₘ κ.comap f hf).map (Prod.map f id) = μ.map f ⊗ₘ κ`.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd_restrict_left` — restricting the base to `s` restricts the
  composition-product to `s ×ˢ univ`.

/-- If a kernel factors through a measurable map `f : W → Y`, then pushing the base of the
composition-product forward along `f` gives back the composition-product over the pushed-forward
base: `(μ ⊗ₘ κ.comap f hf).map (Prod.map f id) = μ.map f ⊗ₘ κ`.

Without the factorization hypothesis the left-hand side genuinely depends on more than `μ.map f`,
so the `comap` on the left is not decoration. -/
