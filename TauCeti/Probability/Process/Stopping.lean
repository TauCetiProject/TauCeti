# Stopping times and stopped paths

A stopping time remains a stopping time for a larger filtration. This transports stopping
arguments and localizing sequences when augmenting a filtration. Finite suprema preserve
the stopping-time property.

Stopping preserves right continuity at each time, including when the stopping time is infinite.
This pathwise fact requires no measurability or stopping-time hypothesis and lets local-martingale
arguments retain the right continuity of their native stopped stages.

Simultaneous almost-sure nonnegativity controls random-time evaluations, including stopped
processes restricted by an indicator (`MeasureTheory.ae_nonneg_stoppedProcess_indicator`).
Pathwise set membership up to the random time also passes to the stopped process. Neither
fact requires a stopping-time or measurability assumption.
