# Process-level ↔ path-law bridges for exchangeability

This file connects the process-level `FullyExchangeable`/`Exchangeable` predicates with the
path-space `ExchangeableLaw` predicate: a process is fully exchangeable exactly when its
`pathLaw` is an exchangeable path-space law, and (under a finite base law) finite exchangeability
is the same statement. It also connects process-level contractability with the path-space
`ContractableLaw` predicate.

The bridges realize the Layer 0 roadmap item asking for process-level ↔ path-law bridges in both
directions. They reuse the existing `FullyExchangeable` path-law bridge from
`FullyExchangeable.lean` and the contractability bridge from `Contractability.lean`; no
measure-theoretic infrastructure is vendored.
