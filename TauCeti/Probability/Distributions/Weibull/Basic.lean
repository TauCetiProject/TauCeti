# The Weibull distribution

The Weibull law with shape `k` and scale `lam` has density
`(k / lam) * (x / lam) ^ (k - 1) * exp (-(x / lam) ^ k)` on the positive
half-line. This file defines the law, proves that it is a probability measure exactly when both
parameters are positive, computes its cdf and all natural moments, and deduces its mean and
variance.

Invalid parameters produce the zero measure. This convention makes `weibullMeasure` a total,
jointly measurable family without pretending that a nonpositive shape or scale defines a
probability law.

The proofs use two successive changes of variables. Scaling by `lam` removes the scale, then
`y = x ^ k` turns the density into `exp (-y)`. The same reduction identifies the upper tail.
Natural moments reduce to Euler's Gamma integral.

## Main definitions and results

* `weibullPDFReal`, `weibullPDF` and `weibullMeasure` define the density and law;
* `weibullMeasure_def` exposes the defining `withDensity` equation, and
  `integrable_weibullMeasure_iff` and `integral_weibullMeasure_eq` transfer integrability and
  integrals against the law to the density;
* `isProbabilityMeasure_weibullMeasure_iff` characterizes the valid parameter range;
* `weibullMeasure_Iic_zero` and `ae_pos_weibullMeasure` record that every Weibull measure is
  concentrated on the positive half-line;
* `cdf_weibullMeasure_eq` gives the closed cdf;
* `integral_pow_weibullMeasure` gives every natural moment;
* `integral_id_weibullMeasure` and `variance_id_weibullMeasure` give the mean and variance;
* `weibullMeasure_one_eq_expMeasure` identifies shape-one Weibull laws with exponential laws;
* `measurable_weibullMeasure` makes the family available for kernel constructions.

/-- **A shape-one Weibull law is exponential.** Its scale `lam` is the reciprocal of the
exponential rate. No positivity is needed: at a nonpositive scale both sides are the zero
measure, since the exponential law is the shape-one Gamma law, whose density is `ENNReal.ofReal`
of a nonpositive quantity at a nonpositive rate. -/
