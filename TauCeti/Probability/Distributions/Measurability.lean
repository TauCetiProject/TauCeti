# Measurability of the standard families in their parameters

A distribution is a family of measures indexed by its parameters, and `MeasureTheory.Measure α`
carries the Giry measurable structure. This file proves parameter measurability for Mathlib's
Gamma, exponential, Beta, Pareto, Cauchy, Poisson, geometric, Bernoulli and binomial scalar laws,
which is exactly what a consumer needs in order to package them as
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel`s.

## Two mechanisms

The absolutely continuous families are all `volume.withDensity` of their density, so they are
handled once and for all by Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.measurable_withDensity`: it is enough
to know that the density is measurable **jointly** in the parameters and the point. That is the
content of the `measurable_uncurry_...` lemmas below, and it is a genuinely stronger statement than
the per-parameter measurability Mathlib provides for most of these families -- `Real.Gamma` and
`ProbabilityTheory.beta` now vary too, which is why `Real.measurable_Gamma` is needed. Mathlib
already provides the joint Gaussian density and parameter measurability results.

The discrete families are weighted sums of Dirac measures, and are handled by the shared
`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.measurable_sum_smul_dirac`, which evaluates such a measure on a set as a
`tsum` of the weights. The binomial law is the finite such sum
`ProbabilityTheory.binomial_eq_sum_dirac`, and is evaluated directly.

Two families are defined by a case split at a degenerate parameter — `cauchyMeasure x₀ 0` and
`geometricMeasure 0` are Dirac measures — and their proofs go through `Measurable.ite`: the
degenerate parameter set is closed, and `Measure.dirac` is itself measurable.

## Main results

* `measurable_gammaMeasure`, `measurable_expMeasure`, `measurable_betaMeasure`,
  `measurable_paretoMeasure`, `measurable_cauchyMeasure` — five continuous families of
  `TauCeti/Probability/Distributions/PDFInstances.lean`; Mathlib provides
  `ProbabilityTheory.measurable_gaussianReal` for the Gaussian family;
* `measurable_poissonMeasure`, `measurable_geometricMeasure`, `measurable_bernoulliMeasure`,
  `measurable_binomial` — the discrete families;
* `measurable_beta` — the Beta normalizing constant `ProbabilityTheory.beta`, needed on the way and
  of independent interest;
The parameter measurability of `uniformMeasure` is `TauCeti.Probability.measurable_uniformMeasure`,
in `TauCeti/Probability/Distributions/Uniform.lean`, next to that family's other results.

## References

* Roadmap: `TauCetiRoadmap/StandardDistributions/README.md`, Layer 0, item 4 — parameter
  measurability, with `measurable_gammaMeasure` and `measurable_poissonMeasure` as the named
  targets. Item 2 of the same layer, the Radon-Nikodym derivatives, is a separate target and is not
  built here.

/-! ### The Beta normalizing constant -/

/-- `ProbabilityTheory.beta` is measurable in its two parameters.

It is `Real.Gamma α * Real.Gamma β / Real.Gamma (α + β)`, so this is `Real.measurable_Gamma` three
times. No positivity is assumed: measurability is a statement about the total function, junk values
at the poles of `Real.Gamma` included. -/

/-! ### Joint measurability of the continuous densities

Each lemma says that the density is measurable as a function of the pair (parameters, point). This
is what `MeasureTheory.measurable_withDensity` consumes; Mathlib's `measurable_gammaPDFReal`
and its analogues fix the parameters and are therefore too weak. -/

`expMeasure r` is `gammaMeasure 1 r`, so this is `measurable_gammaMeasure` along the line `a = 1`.

/-! ### The discrete families -/

/-- **The Poisson family is measurable in its rate.**

The roadmap's Layer 4 composes this with `Real.toNNReal` to build the Gamma-mixed Poisson kernel. -/

/-- **The geometric family is measurable in its success probability.**

At `p = 0` the law is `Measure.dirac 0` rather than a weighted sum, so the proof splits along the
measurable set `{p | p ≠ 0}` of the unit interval. -/
@[fun_prop]
theorem measurable_geometricMeasure : Measurable fun p : unitInterval => geometricMeasure p := by
  simp only [geometricMeasure]
  refine Measurable.ite ?_ (TauCeti.MeasureTheory.measurable_sum_smul_dirac fun n => by fun_prop)

/-- **The binomial family is measurable in its number of trials and its success probability.**

`ProbabilityTheory.binomial_eq_sum_dirac` writes `Bin(n, p)` as a finite weighted sum of Dirac
measures whose weights are polynomial in `p`, so each fibre `n` is measurable in `p`, and `ℕ` is
countable and discrete. -/
