# Decompositions of finitely supported functions on linear orders

A finitely supported function splits into its coordinates below a chosen index, its value at
that index, and its coordinates above it.

A natural-valued finitely supported function with an index below `l` in its support splits as
`single i 1 + g`, where `i < l` and every index in the support of `g` is at least `i`.
This decomposition supports induction on ordered monomials by removing one occurrence of
their least variable.
