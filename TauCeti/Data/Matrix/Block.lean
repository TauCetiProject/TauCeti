# Idempotent block-diagonal matrices

The block-diagonal matrix `Matrix.fromBlocks e 0 0 f` is the direct sum of the square matrices `e`
and `f`. It is idempotent when `e` and `f` are, which is how direct sums of idempotent matrices,
and hence the addition of algebraic `K₀`, are formed.

## Main results

* `IsIdempotentElem.fromBlocks_zero₁₂_zero₂₁`: the direct sum of idempotent matrices is
  idempotent.
