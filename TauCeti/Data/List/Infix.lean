# Prefixes of repeated lists, and infixes of concatenations

Concatenating fewer copies of a list gives a prefix of concatenating more copies. A list which,
followed by an entry `y`, begins with `k` copies of an entry `x ≠ y` itself begins with these `k`
copies. A list with no entry in `l₁` that is an infix of `l₁ ++ l₂` is an infix of `l₂`.
