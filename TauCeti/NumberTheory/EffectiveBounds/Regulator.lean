# The regulator of a number field of unit rank zero

The regulator `R_F` of a number field `F` is the covolume of its unit lattice
(`NumberField.Units.regulator`). When the unit rank is zero — equivalently, `F` has a single
infinite place, so `F = ℚ` or `F` is imaginary quadratic — the unit lattice lives in the
zero-dimensional log space, and its covolume is the empty determinant `1`.

This is the base case of the effective-bounds roadmap's Layer 3 (regulators and unit-lattice
volume): the exact value `R_F = 1` on the fields where the regulator carries no information.
Mathlib defines the regulator and proves it positive (`NumberField.Units.regulator_pos`) but
does not evaluate it in the rank-zero case. Callers needing the corresponding lower bound can
apply `.ge` to these exact evaluations.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.regulator_eq_one_of_rank_eq_zero`: `R_F = 1` when the unit rank
  of `F` is zero.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.regulator_rat_eq_one`: `R_ℚ = 1`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.regulator_eq_one_of_isTotallyComplex_of_finrank_eq_two`:
  `R_F = 1` for an imaginary quadratic field `F`.

/-- **The regulator of a number field of unit rank zero is `1`.** When the unit rank is zero,
the unit lattice sits inside the zero-dimensional log space, and the regulator — its covolume,
computed by `NumberField.Units.regulator_eq_det'` as a determinant indexed by the infinite
places other than the distinguished one — is the determinant of the empty matrix, `1`. -/
