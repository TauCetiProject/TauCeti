# The regulator of a number field of unit rank zero

The regulator `R_F` of a number field `F` is the covolume of its unit lattice
(`NumberField.Units.regulator`). When the unit rank is zero — equivalently, `F` has a single
infinite place, so `F = ℚ` or `F` is imaginary quadratic — the unit lattice lives in the
zero-dimensional log space, and its covolume is the empty determinant `1`.

This is the base case of the effective-bounds roadmap's Layer 3 (regulators and unit-lattice
volume): the exact value `R_F = 1`, which is in particular the trivial lower bound `1 ≤ R_F`,
on the fields where the regulator carries no information. Mathlib defines the regulator and
proves it positive (`NumberField.Units.regulator_pos`) but does not evaluate it in the
rank-zero case.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.regulator_eq_one_of_rank_eq_zero`: `R_F = 1` when the unit rank
  of `F` is zero.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.one_le_regulator_of_rank_eq_zero`: `1 ≤ R_F` when the unit rank
  of `F` is zero.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.regulator_rat_eq_one`: `R_ℚ = 1`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.one_le_regulator_rat`: `1 ≤ R_ℚ`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.regulator_eq_one_of_isTotallyComplex_of_finrank_eq_two`:
  `R_F = 1` for an imaginary quadratic field `F`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.Units.one_le_regulator_of_isTotallyComplex_of_finrank_eq_two`:
  `1 ≤ R_F` for an imaginary quadratic field `F`.
