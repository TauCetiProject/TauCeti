# The maximal elementary-2 quotient `Cl(R)/Cl(R)²` of a class group

For a domain `R` (for the genus-theory application, the ring of integers `𝓞 K` of a number field,
whose class group is finite), the **class group** `ClassGroup R` is an abelian group, and genus
theory studies its `2`-part through the quotient by its subgroup of squares,
`Cl(R) / Cl(R)²`. Every element of this quotient has order dividing `2`, so it is a vector space
over `𝔽₂ = ZMod 2`; its dimension is the **2-rank** of the class group, the quantity the genus-field
theorems compute.

⚠ This quotient is the **maximal elementary-2 quotient** of the class group, *not* the 2-torsion
subgroup `Cl(R)[2] = {C | C² = 1}`. The two are different objects — a quotient and a subgroup — but
for a finite abelian group they have the same cardinality (see
`card_elementaryTwoQuotient_eq_card_twoTorsion`); we keep them distinct in names and statements.

The construction itself is the general `TauCeti.elementaryTwoQuotient` of a commutative group,
specialized here to `G = ClassGroup R` under the genus-theory names Layer 2 of the multiquadratic
roadmap targets (`TauCetiRoadmap/Multiquadratic/README.md`). The same general construction is the
square-class group `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)²` of `TauCeti.FieldTheory.SquareClassGroup` for `G = Kˣ`.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.ClassGroup.elementaryTwoQuotient`: the quotient `Cl(R) ⧸ Cl(R)²`, a `ZMod 2`-module.
* `TauCeti.ClassGroup.elementaryTwoQuotientMk` and `elementaryTwoQuotientMk_eq_zero_iff`: the class
  of an ideal class, trivial iff that class is a square; `elementaryTwoQuotientMk_mul`,
  `elementaryTwoQuotientMk_one`, and `elementaryTwoQuotientMk_prod` record its additivity, while
  `elementaryTwoQuotientMk_surjective` and `elementaryTwoQuotientMk_eq_iff` give surjectivity and
  the equality criterion.
* `TauCeti.ClassGroup.card_elementaryTwoQuotient_eq_card_twoTorsion`: `|Cl(R)/Cl(R)²| = |Cl(R)[2]|`,
  the quotient and the 2-torsion subgroup have equal cardinality.
* `TauCeti.ClassGroup.twoRank` and `card_elementaryTwoQuotient_eq_two_pow_twoRank`: the 2-rank, with
  `|Cl(R)/Cl(R)²| = 2 ^ twoRank`.
