# Square roots of integers as algebraic integers

An element `x` of a field `K` with `x² = d` for an integer `d` is integral over `ℤ` (its square
is an integer, which is integral); this file packages such an `x` as an element
`TauCeti.NumberField.integralSqrt hx` of the ring of integers `𝓞 K`, together with its two
defining identities (its image in `K` is `x`, and it squares to `d` in `𝓞 K`), and the recasting
of the defining equation over `ℚ`.

This is the shared square-root packaging used by the multiquadratic Layer 1 files: the
splitting law (`TauCeti.NumberTheory.Multiquadratic.MultiquadraticSplitting`) moves the
generators `√dᵢ` into `𝓞 K` to compare residues, and the Frobenius computation
(`TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Frobenius`) applies the arithmetic-Frobenius congruence,
which lives on `𝓞 K`, to a square root.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.isIntegral_of_sq_eq_intCast`: a square root of an integer is integral.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.integralSqrt`: the packaging in `𝓞 K`, with
  `TauCeti.NumberField.algebraMap_integralSqrt` and `TauCeti.NumberField.integralSqrt_sq`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.sq_eq_algebraMap_rat`: the defining equation `x² = d` recast over `ℚ`.
