# Irreducibility of the cyclotomic polynomial from the degree of a cyclotomic extension

Mathlib proves `[L : K] = φ n` for an `n`-th cyclotomic extension `L / K` once `Φ_n` is known to be
irreducible over `K` (`IsCyclotomicExtension.finrank`). This file records the converse: the degree
of `L / K` is always at most `φ n`, and as soon as it is at least `φ n` the polynomial `Φ_n` is
irreducible over `K`. That converse and Mathlib's forward direction give the equivalence
`IsCyclotomicExtension.irreducible_cyclotomic_iff_finrank_eq_totient`.

The argument is the classical one. `L = K(ζ)` for a primitive `n`-th root of unity `ζ`, so `[L : K]`
is the degree of the minimal polynomial of `ζ` over `K`, and that minimal polynomial divides `Φ_n`;
hence `[L : K] ≤ φ n`, and if equality holds then `Φ_n` is a monic multiple of the minimal
polynomial of the same degree, so the two coincide and `Φ_n` is irreducible.

## Main results

* `IsCyclotomicExtension.finrank_le_totient`: `[L : K] ≤ φ n`.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.irreducible_cyclotomic_of_totient_le_finrank`: if `φ n ≤ [L : K]` then
  `Φ_n` is irreducible over `K`.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.irreducible_cyclotomic_iff_finrank_eq_totient`: `Φ_n` is irreducible over
  `K` if and only if `[L : K] = φ n`.
* `IsCyclotomicExtension.card_aut_eq_sub_one`: a `q`-th cyclotomic extension with `Φ_q`
  irreducible has exactly `q - 1` automorphisms, for `q` prime.

/-- **The degree of a cyclotomic extension is at most `φ n`.**

The bound is unconditional: nothing is assumed about `cyclotomic n K`. That is what separates it
from Mathlib's `IsCyclotomicExtension.finrank`, which gives the sharper `[L : K] = φ n` but only
under `Irreducible (cyclotomic n K)`. Reach for this one when that irreducibility is unknown, or
is itself what is being proved.

`φ n ≤ [L : K]` then the minimal polynomial of a primitive `n`-th root of unity, a monic divisor of
`Φ_n`, has degree `φ n`, so it is `Φ_n`, which is therefore irreducible.

/-- **A `q`-th cyclotomic extension has exactly `q - 1` automorphisms**, for `q` prime with `Φ_q`
irreducible over `K`. Mathlib's `IsCyclotomicExtension.autEquivPow` identifies the automorphism
group with `(ZMod q)ˣ` under that hypothesis, `ZMod.card_units_eq_totient` counts the latter, and
`Nat.totient_prime` evaluates `φ q` as `q - 1`; the subtraction is truncated `ℕ` subtraction, which
agrees with the totient because `q` is prime.

`hirr` is explicit rather than derived, so a caller cannot reach the count `q - 1` without
supplying the irreducibility that justifies it. `NeZero q` is obtained from `hq`, so callers need
not carry that instance. -/
