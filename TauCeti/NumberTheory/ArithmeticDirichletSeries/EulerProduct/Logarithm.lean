# The Euler product over the primes of a number field, in exponential form

Mathlib's `EulerProduct.exp_tsum_primes_log_eq_tsum` writes the Euler product of a completely
multiplicative `f : ℕ →*₀ ℂ` as `exp (∑' p, -log (1 - f p))`. This file is the ideal-indexed
analogue, over the height-one primes of the ring of integers of a number field, mirroring the way
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.hasProd_eulerFactor` mirrors Mathlib's product form.

The logarithm is taken factor by factor, using the principal value: absolute convergence of the
ideal-indexed series forces each local ratio into the open unit disc, where `Complex.log (1 - ·)`
is defined without choosing anything.

**What this does not give.** `exp` is not injective, so an identity of the form `exp t = L`
determines `t` only modulo `2πi ℤ`; these theorems therefore do not exhibit a logarithm *of* the
`L`-series, and in particular are not a holomorphic branch on a region. Obtaining one needs the
series to be nonvanishing there first, which
`TauCeti.NumberTheory.ArithmeticDirichletSeries.EulerProduct.Analytic` states it does not supply.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MultiplicativeIdealWeight.exp_tsum_neg_log_one_sub_eq_LSeries`: the `L`-series as the
  exponential of a sum of principal logarithms over the primes.

/-- **The Euler product in exponential form.** For a completely multiplicative ideal weight whose
ideal-indexed series converges absolutely at `s`, the `L`-series is the exponential of the sum of
principal logarithms `-log (1 - χ(P) N(P)⁻ˢ)` over the height-one primes.

The sum is not thereby a logarithm of the `L`-series: `exp` identifies it only modulo `2πi ℤ`.
This is the number-field analogue of Mathlib's `EulerProduct.exp_tsum_primes_log_eq_tsum`, and
carries the same limitation. -/
