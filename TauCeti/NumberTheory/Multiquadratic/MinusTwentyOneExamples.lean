# The `-21` prime-discriminant radicand field worked examples

The worked examples in the multiquadratic roadmap identify the genus field for `ℚ(√-21)` as
`ℚ(√-1, √-3, √-7)`, attached to the prime discriminants `-4`, `-3`, and `-7`. This file
re-exports the degree and Galois-cardinality worked examples.

The prime-discriminant convention follows the standard genus-theory convention in Cox's
*Primes of the Form x² + ny²* and Lemmermeyer's *Reciprocity Laws*.

## Main result

* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.finrank_adjoin_I_sqrt_neg_three_sqrt_neg_seven`: the
  worked-example degree `[ℚ(i, √-3, √-7) : ℚ] = 8`.
* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.card_aut_adjoin_I_sqrt_neg_three_sqrt_neg_seven`: the
  worked-example cardinality `|Gal(ℚ(i, √-3, √-7)/ℚ)| = 8`.
