# Multiquadratic CM fields

A multiquadratic *CM* field is one of the form `ℚ(i, √p₁, …, √pₙ)`: a totally imaginary
multiquadratic field obtained by adjoining `√(-1)` together with the square roots of distinct
primes. The roadmap's worked example asks to recover the field
`ℚ(i, √q₀, …, √q_{g-1})` of the Erdős unit-distance formalization as a multiquadratic field of
degree `2^{g+1}`; this file supplies exactly that degree.

The single new ingredient over the prime-radicand theory is the radicand `-1`. Square-class
independence is preserved when one **negative** radicand is adjoined to a square-class
independent family of **positive** radicands: a nonempty subset product either avoids the
negative radicand (and is a positive non-square by hypothesis) or includes it exactly once
(and is then negative, hence not a square in an ordered field). This is recorded field-generically
in `not_isSquare_prod_optionNeg`, and the CM degree is the corollary for `K = ℚ` indexed by
`Option ι`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.not_isSquare_prod_optionNeg`: adjoining a negative radicand to a
  positive square-class independent family preserves square-class independence — stated over an
  arbitrary ordered field for the `Option`-indexed family.
* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.finrank_adjoin_I_sqrt_primes`: `[ℚ(i, √p₁, …, √pₙ) : ℚ] = 2^{|ι|+1}`
  for a finite family of distinct primes — the multiquadratic CM degree.
* `TauCeti.Multiquadratic.finrank_adjoin_I_sqrt_two`: `[ℚ(i, √2) : ℚ] = 4`, the smallest
  nontrivial multiquadratic CM degree.

/-- **Adjoining a negative radicand preserves square-class independence.** Let `d : ι → K` be a
family of positive radicands in an ordered field, no nonempty subset product of which is a
square, and let `c < 0`. Index by `Option ι`, sending `none` to `c` and `some i` to `d i`. Then
no nonempty subset product of this extended family is a square: a subset that avoids `none` is a
nonempty positive non-square by hypothesis, and a subset that contains `none` has a negative
product (the negative `c` times a positive product), so it is not a square either. -/

/-- **Degree of a multiquadratic CM field.** For a finite family of distinct primes `p : ι → ℕ`,
the field `ℚ(i, √p₁, …, √pₙ)` generated over `ℚ` by `i` and the real square roots of the `p i`
has degree `2^{|ι|+1}`. This recovers the Erdős CM field `ℚ(i, √q₀, …, √q_{g-1})` as a
multiquadratic field, the worked example of the roadmap. -/
