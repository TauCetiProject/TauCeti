/-! # Convergence in measure: bounds and continuous transformations

A standard way to consume concentration inequalities: if for each index `i` the
deviation `edist (f i x) (g x)` exceeds some deterministic `rate i` only on a
set of small measure, and `rate` tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in
measure.  This is how "with high probability, the error is at most `rate i`"
statements are converted into `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure`.

No measurability is required of the exceptional sets, since the squeeze only
uses monotonicity of the (outer) measure; the index runs along an arbitrary
filter, matching the generality of `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure`.

Convergence in mean square also implies convergence in measure, with integrability of the
squared deviations required only eventually along the filter.

Pairing preserves convergence in measure along arbitrary filters and for arbitrary measures.
On finite measure spaces, continuous transformations preserve convergence along countably
generated filters whenever the transformed functions are eventually almost everywhere strongly
measurable.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_integral_norm_sq`: convergence in mean square
  implies convergence in measure for any measure and filter.
* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_edist`: the `edist`
  form, for an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued rate and a target with an extended distance.
* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_dist`: the `dist`
  form, for a real-valued rate and a pseudometric target.
* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_dist_le_rate`: the
  high-probability phrasing for a probability measure, with hypothesis
  `μ {x | dist (f i x) (g x) ≤ rate i} → 1`; here null-measurability of the
  good events (eventually along the filter) is genuinely needed, since an outer
  measure can assign full measure to both a set and its complement.
* `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure.prodMk`: convergence in measure of paired functions,
  for arbitrary measures and filters, without measurability assumptions.
* `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure.continuous_comp`: continuous unary transformations on
  finite measure spaces along countably generated filters.
* `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure.continuous_comp₂`: the corresponding binary transformation
  theorem, obtained by pairing and unary composition.

If `f i` is within `rate i` of `g` outside a set whose measure tends to `0`,
and `rate` tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in measure.

This is the form in which concentration inequalities ("with high probability,
`edist (f i x) (g x) ≤ rate i`") are consumed.  No measurability of the
exceptional sets is needed: the proof only uses monotonicity of the measure.

If a real-valued rate tends to zero and the measure of the events
`{x | rate i < dist (f i x) (g x)}` tends to zero, then `f` converges to `g`
in measure. The rate may be negative, and no measurability assumption on the
exceptional sets is required.

/--
**High-probability phrasing.** If, for a probability measure, the events
"`f i` is within `rate i` of `g`" have probability tending to `1` and `rate`
tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in measure.

Unlike `tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_dist`, null-measurability
of the good events cannot be dropped here (it is required only eventually along
`l`): an outer measure can assign measure `1` to both a set and its complement,
so `μ s → 1` alone says nothing about `μ sᶜ`.
