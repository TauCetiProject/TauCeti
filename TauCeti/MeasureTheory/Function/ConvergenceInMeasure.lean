/-! # Convergence in measure: high-probability rates and continuous transformations

A standard way to consume concentration inequalities: if for each index `i` the
deviation `edist (f i x) (g x)` exceeds some deterministic `rate i` only on a
set of small measure, and `rate` tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in
measure.  This is how "with high probability, the error is at most `rate i`"
statements are converted into `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure`.

No measurability is required of the exceptional sets, since the squeeze only
uses monotonicity of the (outer) measure; the index runs along an arbitrary
filter, matching the generality of `MeasureTheory.TendstoInMeasure`.

On finite measure spaces, continuous binary transformations preserve sequential convergence
in measure whenever the transformed functions are almost everywhere strongly measurable.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_edist`: the `edist`
  form, for an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued rate and a target with an extended distance.
* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_dist`: the `dist`
  form, for a real-valued rate and a pseudometric target.
* `TauCeti.tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_dist_le_rate`: the
  high-probability phrasing for a probability measure, with hypothesis
  `μ {x | dist (f i x) (g x) ≤ rate i} → 1`; here null-measurability of the
  good events (eventually along the filter) is genuinely needed, since an outer
  measure can assign full measure to both a set and its complement.

If `f i` is within `rate i` of `g` outside a set whose measure tends to `0`,
and `rate` tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in measure.

This is the form in which concentration inequalities ("with high probability,
`edist (f i x) (g x) ≤ rate i`") are consumed.  No measurability of the
exceptional sets is needed: the proof only uses monotonicity of the measure.

If a real-valued rate tends to zero and the measure of the events
`{x | rate i < dist (f i x) (g x)}` tends to zero, then `f` converges to `g`
in measure. The rate may be negative, and no measurability assumption on the
exceptional sets is required.

**High-probability phrasing.** If, for a probability measure, the events
"`f i` is within `rate i` of `g`" have probability tending to `1` and `rate`
tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `g` in measure.

Unlike `tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_measure_rate_lt_dist`, null-measurability
of the good events cannot be dropped here (it is required only eventually along
`l`): an outer measure can assign measure `1` to both a set and its complement,
so `μ s → 1` alone says nothing about `μ sᶜ`.
