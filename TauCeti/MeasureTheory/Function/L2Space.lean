# Inner products of square-integrable functions

The pointwise inner product of two square-integrable functions with values in an inner product
space is integrable. Mathlib states this for elements of `L²` (`MeasureTheory.L2.integrable_inner`);
this file gives the form for functions satisfying `MemLp f 2 μ`, which is how second-moment
hypotheses on random vectors are usually stated, together with the special case of a quadratic
form `⟪B (f x), f x⟫` of a matrix `B` on a Euclidean-valued function.
For counting measure, singleton-supported vectors separate L² functions. On a compact space with
a finite measure, the L² pairing of an L² function with a continuous function is an integral
(`MeasureTheory.L2.inner_toLp_continuousMap`), extending Mathlib's `ContinuousMap.inner_toLp`.
The integral of `⟪f x, c⟫` is `⟪∫ f, c⟫` (`integral_inner_left`), the counterpart of Mathlib's
`integral_inner` with the integrand in the left slot.
