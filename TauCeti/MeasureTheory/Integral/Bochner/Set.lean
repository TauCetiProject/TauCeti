# Continuity of parametric integrals with compactly supported integrand

Mathlib's `continuousOn_integral_of_compact_support` gives continuity of a parametric integral on
a set. This file records its global form: a jointly continuous integrand which vanishes unless the
integration variable lies in a fixed compact set has a continuous parametric integral, against any
measure which is finite on compact sets. It also records that the indicator function of a
bounded interval `[a, b)` is integrable against a locally finite measure, that the integral of
`|f|` over a set splits along the sign of `f`, and that a continuous
square-integrable function `h` with `∫ conj (h x) * h x = 0` vanishes, against a measure positive
on nonempty open sets.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.continuous_integral_of_compact_support`: the parametric integral of a jointly
  continuous integrand which vanishes unless `r ∈ K`, for compact `K`, is continuous.
* `TauCeti.integrable_indicator_Ico_one`: the indicator function of `[a, b)` is integrable.
* `TauCeti.setIntegral_abs_eq_sub`: the integral of `|f|` over `s` is the integral of `f` over the
  part of `s` where `f ≥ 0` minus its integral over the rest of `s`.
* `Continuous.eq_zero_of_integral_conj_mul_self_eq_zero`: a continuous square-integrable function
  `h` with `∫ conj (h x) * h x = 0` vanishes.
