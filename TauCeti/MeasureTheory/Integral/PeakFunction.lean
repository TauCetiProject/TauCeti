# Integrals against `L¹` peak functions concentrating at a point

Let `f i` be a net of `L¹` classes of unit integral, `∫ f i = 1`, with uniformly bounded `L¹` norms,
which concentrate at a point `x₀`: for every neighbourhood `U` of `x₀`, eventually each `f i`
vanishes almost everywhere outside `U`. Then `∫ x, f i x • φ x ∂μ` tends to `a` for every `φ`
with limit `a` at `x₀` whose products `f i • φ` with the weights are almost everywhere strongly
measurable. This is the approximate-identity argument in its pointwise form: since `∫ f i = 1`,
the difference is `∫ x, f i x • (φ x - a) ∂μ`, and `φ x` stays close to `a` on the set where
`f i` lives.

Only the integrands `f i • φ` are asked to be almost everywhere strongly measurable, not `φ`
itself. This holds when `φ` is, but also for a continuous `φ` and a measure that is inner regular
for compact sets but not σ-finite, such as the Haar measure `MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaar` of a
locally compact group that is not σ-compact
(`MeasureTheory.AEFinStronglyMeasurable.aestronglyMeasurable_smul`).

On a measure that charges every open set and is finite on some neighbourhood of each point, such
peak functions exist inside every neighbourhood of every point (normalized indicators), so the
statement is never vacuous.

The weights here are `L¹` classes with values in an `RCLike` field, as consumed by integrated forms
of representations. Mathlib's peak-function results
(`tendsto_integral_peak_smul_of_integrable_of_tendsto` in
`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/PeakFunction.lean`) do not apply in that situation: they ask for
nonnegative real weights, defined pointwise, and for `φ` to be integrable. The latter fails for the
orbits `g ↦ π g v` of a unitary representation of a non-compact group, which have constant norm.
Similarly, `tendsto_integral_smul_of_tendsto_average_norm_sub` asks for pointwise bounds
`|g i| ≤ K / μ (a i)` on the weights. Here, instead, `φ` only has to be bounded near `x₀`, which
its limit at `x₀` provides.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.norm_integral_smul_sub_le`: the approximate-identity estimate
  `‖∫ x, f x • φ x ∂μ - y‖ ≤ ε * ‖f‖` when `∫ f = 1`, `f` vanishes off `U`, and `φ` stays within `ε`
  of `y` on `U`.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_integral_smul_of_tendsto`: a net of `L¹` peak functions concentrating at
  `x₀` integrates `φ` to its limit at `x₀`.
* `TauCeti.exists_integral_eq_one_norm_eq_one`: peak functions of unit integral and unit
  `L¹` norm exist inside every neighbourhood of a point.

/-- **The approximate-identity estimate.** If an `L¹` class `f` has unit integral and vanishes
almost everywhere outside `U`, and `φ` stays within `ε` of `y` on `U`, then the integral of `φ`
against `f` is within `ε * ‖f‖` of `y`. The integrand `f • φ` is assumed almost everywhere
strongly measurable. -/
