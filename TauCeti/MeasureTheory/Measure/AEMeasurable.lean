# Pushing forward a restricted measure

Restricting a measure before pushing it forward along an almost everywhere measurable map can only
decrease the pushforward. This complements Mathlib's
`MeasureTheory.Measure.map_mono_of_aemeasurable`.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_restrict_le_map` — `(μ.restrict s).map f ≤ μ.map f` for an
  almost everywhere measurable `f`, with no hypothesis on `s`.
