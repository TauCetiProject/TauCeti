# The measure of a set in concentric balls

Let `μ` be a measure finite on compact sets on a proper metric space, and write
`m(ρ) = μ(s ∩ ball x₀ ρ)` for the measure of a set `s` in the balls about `x₀`. The function `m`
is monotone in the radius (`TauCeti.monotone_measureReal_inter_ball`), and two concentric balls of
the same measure agree up to a null set (`TauCeti.ball_ae_eq_ball_of_measure_eq`). Monotonicity
makes `m` differentiable at almost every radius. Where `m` has a right derivative at `r`, the
measures `μ(s ∩ (ball x₀ (r + h) \ ball x₀ r)) / h` of `s` in thin shells tend to it as `h → 0⁺`
(`TauCeti.tendsto_measure_inter_ball_sdiff_ball_div_of_hasDerivWithinAt`). These are the
difference quotients produced by cutting a set by balls with radial cutoffs.

For an arbitrary measure, a bound `μ (closedBall x r) ≤ f r` on concentric closed balls holding
for radii arbitrarily close to `ρ` from the right holds at `ρ` when `f` is right-continuous there
(`MeasureTheory.Measure.measure_closedBall_le_of_frequently_le`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.monotone_measureReal_inter_ball`: `ρ ↦ μ(s ∩ ball x₀ ρ)` is monotone.
* `TauCeti.ball_ae_eq_ball_of_measure_eq`: concentric balls of equal measure agree a.e.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_measure_inter_ball_sdiff_ball_div_of_hasDerivWithinAt`: the lower difference
  quotient of `m` is its right derivative, where that exists.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.measure_closedBall_le_of_frequently_le`: a closed-ball bound for radii
  arbitrarily close to `ρ` from the right extends to `ρ` for a right-continuous gauge.
