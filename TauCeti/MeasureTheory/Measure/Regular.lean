# Inner regularity under almost everywhere continuous maps

A measurable map that is continuous on a measurable set of full measure sends an inner regular
measure to an inner regular measure. Global continuity is unnecessary: compact approximation
can be performed inside the set where the map is continuous. This applies, for example, to
spectral character assignments whose exceptional set has measure zero.
