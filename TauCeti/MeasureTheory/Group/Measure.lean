# Measures and the group operations

This file records measure formulas for finite families of disjoint additive translates.  In
lattice-point counting, the formula turns disjoint translates of a fundamental-domain cell into
measure bounds that can be compared with the number of cells. It also records that inverting or
negating a probability measure gives a probability measure, so that the law of `X⁻¹` or `-X` can
be used wherever a probability law is expected.

## Main results

* `Measure.measure_biUnion_sub_mem`: a finite disjoint union of translates has measure
  equal to the number of translates times the measure of the original set.
* `Measure.isProbabilityMeasure_inv`, `Measure.isProbabilityMeasure_neg`: the inverse and the
  negation of a probability measure are probability measures.
* `Measure.map_inv_comp`, `Measure.map_neg_comp`: composing a pushforward from the inverted or
  negated measure with inversion or negation recovers the original pushforward.
* `Measure.ae_inv_mem_preimage`, `Measure.ae_neg_mem_preimage`: a full-mass set reflects to a
  full-mass set for the inverted or negated measure.
