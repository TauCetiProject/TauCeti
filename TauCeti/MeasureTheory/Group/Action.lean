# Invariant measures of a scalar multiplication

General facts about `SMulInvariantMeasure`, Mathlib's class of measures invariant under a scalar
multiplication, that do not concern ergodicity: the restriction of an invariant measure to an
exactly invariant measurable set is again invariant (`SMulInvariantMeasure.restrict`), and for a
transitive isometric action all balls of one radius have the same invariant measure
(`measure_ball_eq_measure_ball`).
