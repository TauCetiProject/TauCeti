# The closure order on orbits of vectors

Let `G = Spec H` be an affine group over a field `k` acting on a finite-dimensional
representation `M`, and let `TauCeti.Comodule.VectorOrbit k H M` be the set of rational orbits of
`G` in `M`. The orbit of `v` has a geometric image `Oᵥ` (`TauCeti.Comodule.VectorOrbit.image`):
the full topological image of the projective orbit morphism of the line through `(v, 1)` in the
projective completion `P(M × k)` of `M`. Both are defined in
`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.Representation.Orbit.Basic`.

When `k` is algebraically closed and `G` is of finite type, distinct orbits have distinct images,
and even distinct closures. The *closure order* on orbits,

  `O ≤ O'` if and only if `O ⊆ closure O'`,

is therefore a partial order. An orbit lies strictly below another exactly when its vectors lie
in the boundary `closure O' \ O'`, and then it has strictly smaller dimension.

Applied to the adjoint representation of `G` on its Lie algebra, this is the closure order on
adjoint orbits, in particular on nilpotent orbits.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Comodule.VectorOrbit.image_injective`,
  `TauCeti.Comodule.VectorOrbit.closure_image_injective`: orbits are determined by their images,
  and even by the closures of their images.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.VectorOrbit.instPartialOrder`: the closure order.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.VectorOrbit.mk_le_mk_iff`, `TauCeti.Comodule.VectorOrbit.mk_lt_mk_iff`:
  the orbit of `w` lies below the orbit of `v` when `w` lies in the closure of the orbit of
  `v`, and strictly below when `w` lies in its boundary.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.VectorOrbit.strictMono_topologicalKrullDim_image`: strictly smaller orbits
  have strictly smaller dimension.
