# `μ_n` is the kernel of the `n`th power endomorphism of `𝔾ₘ`

The group scheme of `n`th roots of unity `μ_n = D(ℤ/n)` sits inside the multiplicative group
`𝔾ₘ = D(ℤ)` through the inclusion `TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.inclusion`, the contravariant
image of the quotient `ℤ ↠ ℤ/n`. On the other side, `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd n` is
the `n`th power endomorphism `u ↦ u ^ n` of `𝔾ₘ`. This file identifies `μ_n` with the kernel of
that endomorphism: on every commutative `R`-algebra `A`, the image of `μ_n(A) → 𝔾ₘ(A)` is
exactly the set of points killed by the `n`th power, so `μ_n` is the (scheme-theoretic) kernel
`ker(𝔾ₘ --u ↦ uⁿ--> 𝔾ₘ)`.

The mechanism is the worked-example points dictionary. A point of `𝔾ₘ = D(Multiplicative ℤ)` is
determined by the unit it reads off on the generator `Multiplicative.ofAdd 1`
(`DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMulEquiv_ext`). The `n`th power endomorphism raises that unit to the
`n`th power (`DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMulEquiv_powEnd`), while an included `μ_n`-point reads off
the underlying unit of an `n`th root of unity
(`RootsOfUnityGroup.charOfPoint_inclusion_ofAdd_one`), whose `n`th power is `1`. Conversely a
`𝔾ₘ`-point read off as a unit `u` with `u ^ n = 1` is `u ∈ rootsOfUnity n A`, hence the image of
the `μ_n`-point attached to it.

This is a worked-example check for the reductive-groups roadmap
(`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap, Layer 4: "`μ_n = D(ℤ/n)`", "`𝔾_m = D(ℤ)`", and
the diagonalizable anti-equivalence `M ↦ D(M)`), assembling the `μ_n` inclusion
`TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.inclusion` and the power endomorphism
`TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd` of the character/cocharacter file into the classical
description of `μ_n` as a kernel.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.powEnd_comp_inclusion`: the `n`th power endomorphism annihilates
  `μ_n`, i.e. `powEnd n ∘ inclusion n` is trivial.
* `TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.mem_range_inclusion`: a `𝔾ₘ`-point killed by the `n`th power lies
  in the image of the `μ_n` inclusion.
* `TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.range_inclusion`: the image of `μ_n ↪ 𝔾ₘ` is the kernel of the
  `n`th power endomorphism of `𝔾ₘ`.

## References

The `μ_n` inclusion and `𝔾ₘ` points calculation are Tau Ceti's
`TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.inclusion` and `TauCeti.RootsOfUnityGroup.pointsMulEquiv`; the power
endomorphism of `𝔾ₘ` is `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd`. The subgroup of `n`th roots of
unity and `mem_rootsOfUnity` are Mathlib's (`Mathlib.RingTheory.RootsOfUnity.Basic`), and the
one-generator extensionality `MonoidHom.ext_mint` is from `Mathlib.Data.Int.Cast.Lemmas`.
