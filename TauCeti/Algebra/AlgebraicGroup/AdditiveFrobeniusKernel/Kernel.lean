# `αₚ` is the kernel of the Frobenius endomorphism of the additive group

Over a base ring `R` of prime characteristic `p`, the additive group `𝔾ₐ = Spec R[x]` (here
`x = ι R R 1` in `SymmetricAlgebra R R`) carries the **Frobenius endomorphism** `F : 𝔾ₐ → 𝔾ₐ`
(`TauCeti.AdditiveGroup.frobeniusEnd`, of
`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.AdditiveGroup.Frobenius`), which on every commutative `R`-algebra
`A` raises a point to its `p`-th power, `a ↦ aᵖ`.

`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.AdditiveFrobeniusKernel.Basic` builds the Frobenius kernel group
scheme `αₚ = Spec R[x]/(xᵖ)` and identifies its functor of points with the `p`-nilpotent elements
of the additive group. This file exhibits the inclusion `αₚ ↪ 𝔾ₐ` on the functor of points and
proves that `αₚ` is exactly the kernel of the Frobenius endomorphism: as subgroups of the group of
`𝔾ₐ`-points, the image of the inclusion `αₚ ↪ 𝔾ₐ` equals the kernel of the Frobenius endomorphism.
This realizes `αₚ = ker(𝔾ₐ --a ↦ aᵖ--> 𝔾ₐ)` on the functor of points, the additive companion of the
identification of `μ_n` with the kernel of the `n`th power endomorphism of `𝔾ₘ`
(`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.RootsOfUnity.Kernel`).

The mechanism is the worked-example points dictionary. A point of `𝔾ₐ = Spec R[x]` reads off the
element `F(x) : A` (`TauCeti.AdditiveGroup.gaPointsMulEquiv`); the Frobenius endomorphism raises
that element to the `p`-th power (`TauCeti.AdditiveGroup.toAdd_gaPointsMulEquiv_frobeniusEnd`),
while an included `αₚ`-point reads off a `p`-nilpotent element (`aᵖ = 0`), whose `p`-th power
vanishes. Conversely a `𝔾ₐ`-point read off as an element `a` with `aᵖ = 0` is a `p`-nilpotent
element, hence the image of the `αₚ`-point attached to it
(`TauCeti.AlphaP.mem_range_pointsHom_iff`).

This is a worked-example check for the reductive-groups roadmap
(`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap): the standing hypotheses flag `αₚ` as one of the
non-smooth / non-reduced groups an affine group scheme of finite type must admit, described there
as "the kernel of the Frobenius endomorphism", and Layer 3 develops "Hopf ideals ↔ closed
subgroup schemes" with their kernels.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.AlphaP.inclusion`: the inclusion `αₚ ↪ 𝔾ₐ` on points, the contravariant image of the
  quotient map `R[x] ↠ R[x]/(xᵖ)`.
* `TauCeti.AlphaP.inclusion_injective`: the inclusion `αₚ ↪ 𝔾ₐ` is injective on points.
* `TauCeti.AlphaP.mapValue_inclusion`: the inclusion `αₚ ↪ 𝔾ₐ` is natural in the value algebra.
* `TauCeti.AlphaP.frobeniusEnd_comp_inclusion`: the Frobenius endomorphism annihilates `αₚ`.
* `TauCeti.AlphaP.mem_range_inclusion_iff`: a `𝔾ₐ`-point lies in the image of `αₚ` iff the
  Frobenius endomorphism kills it.
* `TauCeti.AlphaP.range_inclusion`: as subgroups of the `𝔾ₐ`-points, the image of `αₚ ↪ 𝔾ₐ` is
  the kernel of the Frobenius endomorphism of `𝔾ₐ`.

## References

The Frobenius endomorphism `TauCeti.AdditiveGroup.frobeniusEnd` of `𝔾ₐ` is Tau Ceti's
`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.AdditiveGroup.Frobenius`; the Frobenius kernel `αₚ` and its
`p`-nilpotent functor of points are `TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.AdditiveFrobeniusKernel.Basic`.
The additive-group points dictionary `TauCeti.AdditiveGroup.gaPointsMulEquiv` and the
coordinate-Hopf-algebra functoriality `TauCeti.AlgHom.mapDomain` (with its naturality
`TauCeti.AlgHom.mapValue_mapDomain`) are Tau Ceti's. This realizes `αₚ = ker(Frobenius)` on the
functor of points, the additive companion of `TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.RootsOfUnity.Kernel`.
