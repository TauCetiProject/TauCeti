# Characters, cocharacters, and their pairing for the diagonalizable group

`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.DiagonalizableGroup` computes the functor of points of the
diagonalizable group `D(M) = Spec R[M]`, and
`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.DiagonalizableGroupFunctoriality` records its contravariant
functoriality `DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMap`. This file uses that functoriality to build the
**character lattice `X*(D(M))`, the cocharacter lattice `X_*(D(M))`, and their perfect pairing**
into the endomorphism lattice of the multiplicative group, all realized on the functor of points.

Throughout, the multiplicative group is `𝔾ₘ = D(Multiplicative ℤ)` in its group-algebra
presentation, so its `A`-points are the units `Aˣ` (its character group `Multiplicative ℤ →* Aˣ`
being determined by the value on the generator, `Mathlib`'s `MonoidHom.apply_mint`). Its
canonical Laurent-polynomial API is `TauCeti.MultiplicativeGroup`, matched to this presentation by
`TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.multiplicativeGroup_pointEquiv_apply`.

* A **character** of `D(M)` is an element `m : M`, giving the homomorphism of group functors
  `D(M) → 𝔾ₘ` whose action on points is evaluation of a character `χ : M →* Aˣ` at `m`.
* A **cocharacter** of `D(M)` is a homomorphism `ψ : M →* Multiplicative ℤ`, giving the
  homomorphism of group functors `𝔾ₘ → D(M)`; on points it sends a unit `u` to the character
  `m ↦ u ^ (ψ m).toAdd`.
* The **`n`-th power endomorphism** `powEnd n` of `𝔾ₘ` acts as `u ↦ u ^ n` on points; power
  endomorphisms compose by multiplication of exponents (`powEnd_comp`, `powEnd_one`), which
  is the ring `End(𝔾ₘ) ≅ ℤ` on the level of power maps.
* The **pairing** `⟨m, ψ⟩ = (ψ m).toAdd : ℤ` is realized as the composite endomorphism
  `character m ∘ cocharacter ψ = powEnd ⟨m, ψ⟩` of `𝔾ₘ` (`charPoints_comp_cocharPoints`). For
  `M = Multiplicative ℤ`, so `X*(𝔾ₘ) = X_*(𝔾ₘ) = ℤ`, the pairing is multiplication
  (`pairing_ofAdd`): the rank-`1` root datum input.

This advances the reductive-groups roadmap (`ReductiveGroups/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap,
Layer 4: "Tori ... the character lattice `X*(T)` and cocharacter lattice `X_*(T)` with their
perfect pairing: the input to root data").

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.charPoints`: the character of `D(M)` at `m : M`, on points.
* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.cocharPoints`: the cocharacter of `D(M)` at `ψ`, on points.
* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.powEnd`: the `n`-th power endomorphism of `𝔾ₘ`, on points.
* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.pairing`: the character–cocharacter pairing `⟨m, ψ⟩ : ℤ`.
* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.charPoints_comp_cocharPoints`: the pairing is realized as the
  composite endomorphism `character m ∘ cocharacter ψ = powEnd ⟨m, ψ⟩`.

## References

The contravariant points functoriality `DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMap` is Tau Ceti's
`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.DiagonalizableGroupFunctoriality`. The one-generator universal
property `zpowersHom : α ≃ (Multiplicative ℤ →* α)` and the induced `MonoidHom.apply_mint` are
Mathlib's (`Mathlib.Data.Int.Cast.Lemmas`). This realizes the character/cocharacter pairing of
the Tau Ceti reductive-groups roadmap (Layer 4).
