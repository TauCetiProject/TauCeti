# The differential of a tensor product of complexes

Mathlib's `HomologicalComplex.monoidalCategory` totalizes the degreewise tensor product of
complexes, with the tensor signs `ε₁ = 1` and `ε₂ (p, q) = (-1)^p`.  This file records the
resulting differential on a homogeneous summand, `d (x ⊗ y) = d x ⊗ y + (-1)^p x ⊗ d y` for `x` of
degree `p`: as a single rewrite rule for cochain complexes of modules indexed by `ℤ`, and as its two
parts `HomologicalComplex.mapBifunctor.D₁` and `HomologicalComplex.mapBifunctor.D₂` for chain
complexes indexed by `ℕ` in any monoidal preadditive category, where a part vanishes on a summand
whose factor of degree zero it would differentiate.

## Main results

* `HomologicalComplex.ι_tensorObj_d`: the differential of `X ⊗ Y` restricted to the summand
  `X.X p ⊗ Y.X q`, for cochain complexes of modules.
* `ChainComplex.ιTensorObj_D₁_succ`, `ChainComplex.ιTensorObj_D₁_zero`,
  `ChainComplex.ιTensorObj_D₂_succ` and `ChainComplex.ιTensorObj_D₂_zero`: the two parts of the
  differential of `K₁ ⊗ K₂` on a homogeneous summand, for chain complexes indexed by `ℕ`.

## Implementation notes

`Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Monoidal.Closed.Braided` is imported for the colimit-preservation
instances that make the tensor product of cochain complexes exist at all, exactly as in
`TauCeti/Algebra/Homology/Monoidal/Braiding.lean`.
