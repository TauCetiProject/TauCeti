# The trace of multiplication by an element of a finite monoid algebra

For a finite monoid `G` the monoid algebra `k[G]` is free on the monoid elements, so multiplication
by a fixed element `x` is an endomorphism of a finite free module and has a trace. In the basis of
monoid elements the matrix of *right* multiplication by `x` has `g`-th diagonal entry `x_1`,
because `g * h = g` forces `h = 1` as soon as `G` cancels on the left; the trace is therefore
`|G| * x_1`, and it sees nothing of `x` beyond its coefficient at the identity. The same count on
the left needs cancellation on the right and gives the same answer, in the matrix form
`TauCeti.trace_leftMulMatrix_monoidAlgebra` that the character-table files consume. A group cancels
on both sides, so all three statements apply to a finite group algebra.

The special case `x = g` recovers the character of the regular representation, but the general
statement is what identifies the scalar in an essential idempotence `c * c = a • c`, by pairing
with `TauCeti.LinearMap.trace_eq_mul_finrank_range`.

Multiplying on both sides at once, the endomorphism `x ↦ g * x * y` of a finite group algebra has
`σ`-th diagonal entry `y_{σ⁻¹ g⁻¹ σ}`, so its trace is the sum of the coefficients of `y` along the
conjugates of `g⁻¹`, each conjugate counted once for every element conjugating `g⁻¹` to it. Over
a field `k`, if `y * y = κ • y`, this trace is `κ` times the character of the left ideal `k[G] y`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.trace_leftMulMatrix_monoidAlgebra`: the matrix form, the trace of the left regular
  matrix of `x` is `|G| * x_1`.
* `TauCeti.MonoidAlgebra.trace_mulRight`: the trace of right multiplication by `x` on `k[G]` is
  `|G| * x_1`.
* `TauCeti.MonoidAlgebra.trace_mulLeft`: the same for left multiplication.
* `MonoidAlgebra.trace_mulLeft_single_mul_mulRight`: the trace of `x ↦ g * x * y` on a
  finite group algebra is `∑ σ, y_{σ⁻¹ g⁻¹ σ}`.
