# Multiplicities of labelled roots

If a finite family enumerates a polynomial's roots with multiplicity, the multiplicity
at each label depends only on which labels coincide. Consequently an eventually constant
collision relation gives eventually constant multiplicities, without any continuity or
splitting assumptions on the polynomial family.

/-- A finite enumeration of roots with an eventually constant collision relation has
eventually constant multiplicity at each label. The parameter filter is arbitrary, and
the root enumeration at the reference parameter is supplied separately. -/
