# Multiplicities of labelled roots

If a finite family enumerates a polynomial's roots with multiplicity, the multiplicity
at each label depends only on which labels coincide. Consequently an eventually constant
collision relation gives eventually constant multiplicities, without any continuity or
splitting assumptions on the polynomial family.

We also count the root zero: it occurs in `f.roots` with multiplicity the order of vanishing
`f.natTrailingDegree`, so the roots satisfying a predicate that holds at zero number
`f.natTrailingDegree` plus the nonzero roots satisfying it.
