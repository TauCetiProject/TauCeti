# Dominant weights and highest weight vectors for `gl n`

Weights of `gl n R` for the diagonal Cartan subalgebra are tuples `μ : n → R`
(`TauCeti.glWeightEquiv`). This file adds the two predicates that highest weight theory for
`gl n` is stated against, both in the matrix unit positive system of
`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/GeneralLinear/Borel.lean`.

The first is **dominance**. For `gl n` it is a condition on *differences*, not on the entries
themselves: a tuple `μ : Fin n → R` over a ring of characteristic zero is dominant integral when
each consecutive difference `μ i - μ (i+1)` is a natural number — characteristic zero is what makes
"is a natural number" a real condition, since over `ZMod p` every element is a natural number cast
and every tuple would qualify. The entries are unconstrained, and that slack is exactly the
central direction: adding a constant tuple `c · (1, …, 1)` — the weight of the centre of `gl n` —
preserves dominance for every `c : R`. The staircase `(N - 1/2, N - 3/2, …, 1/2)` over `ℚ` is
dominant with no integer entry at all, which is what makes the slack visible, and the weakly
decreasing *integer* tuples sit inside the dominant ones as the weights of the rational
representations of the group.

The second is being a **highest weight vector** of weight `μ`: a nonzero vector which the diagonal
matrix units `Eᵢᵢ` scale by `μ i` and which the raising matrix units `Eᵢⱼ`, `i < j`, annihilate.
Those two families are coordinates for the diagonal Cartan subalgebra and generators of the
positive nilpotent subalgebra `𝔫⁺` of strictly upper triangular matrices — which is a Lie ideal of
the standard Borel subalgebra, not of `gl n` itself — so the elementwise conditions are equivalent
to the two coordinate-free ones: the whole Cartan acts by the weight `TauCeti.glWeightEquiv R n μ`,
and the whole of `𝔫⁺` annihilates (`TauCeti.isGlHighestWeightVector_iff_forall_mem`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsGlDominantIntegral μ`: the consecutive differences of `μ : Fin n → R` are natural
  numbers, for `R` of characteristic zero.
* `TauCeti.glStaircase N`: the staircase tuple `(N - 1/2, N - 3/2, …, 1/2) : Fin N → ℚ`.
* `TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector μ v`: `v` is nonzero, the diagonal matrix unit `Eᵢᵢ` acts on it
  by `μ i`, and every raising matrix unit `Eᵢⱼ` with `i < j` annihilates it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsGlDominantIntegral.exists_natCast_sub_of_le`: dominance propagates from consecutive
  indices to all pairs, `μ i - μ j ∈ ℕ` whenever `i ≤ j`, and
  `TauCeti.isGlDominantIntegral_iff_forall_le` records the two forms as equivalent.
* `TauCeti.isGlDominantIntegral_intCast`: an antitone integer tuple is dominant — the weights of
  the group level sit inside the dominant ones.
* `TauCeti.IsGlDominantIntegral.add_const`: dominance is invariant under the central direction, and
  `TauCeti.IsGlDominantIntegral.exists_antitone_natCast_add_const` is the converse decomposition:
  every dominant weight is an antitone tuple of natural numbers translated along that direction.
* `TauCeti.isGlDominantIntegral_glStaircase` and `TauCeti.glStaircase_ne_intCast`: the staircase is
  dominant and no entry of it is an integer, so dominance genuinely does not force integrality.
* `TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector.lie_eq_glWeightEquiv_smul` and
  `TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector.lie_eq_zero_of_mem_strictUpperTriangular`: the whole diagonal
  Cartan subalgebra acts by the weight, and the whole positive nilpotent subalgebra `𝔫⁺`
  annihilates.
* `TauCeti.isGlHighestWeightVector_iff_forall_mem`: those two conditions characterise a highest
  weight vector, so the elementwise definition loses nothing.
* `TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector.weight_eq`: a vector is a highest weight vector for at most one
  weight.
* `TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector.map` and `TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector.congr`: highest weight
  vectors transport along module morphisms that preserve nonzeroness, in particular equivalences.
* `TauCeti.isGlHighestWeightVector_coe_iff`: a vector of a Lie submodule is a highest weight vector
  of that submodule exactly when it is one of the ambient module.
* `TauCeti.forall_one_lie_eq_sum_smul_of_isGlHighestWeightVector`: on an irreducible module carrying
  a highest weight vector, the identity matrix acts by the sum of the entries of that weight.
* `TauCeti.isGlHighestWeightVector_single_bot_top`: the highest root vector `E_{⊥⊤}` is a highest
  weight vector of the adjoint module, of weight `ε_⊥ - ε_⊤`, so the predicate is not vacuous.

## Implementation notes

Both predicates are stated as the conjunctions pinned by the roadmap rather than as structures, so
that they are definitionally the classical conditions; because the bodies are not exposed, the
`Iff` restatements `TauCeti.isGlDominantIntegral_iff` and
`TauCeti.isGlHighestWeightVector_iff` are how they are introduced and eliminated downstream, with
`TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector.ne_zero`,
`TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector.lie_single_self_eq_smul` and
`TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector.lie_single_eq_zero` as the projections.

Dominance is stated for `Fin n`, since "consecutive" refers to the successor on the indices, while
the highest weight condition needs only a linearly ordered index type and is stated for one, as
`TauCeti.strictUpperTriangular` is. Neither needs a field or an algebraically closed field, so both
are over a commutative ring and the roadmap's field case is the instance `R = K`; dominance
additionally asks for `CharZero R`, because "the difference is a natural number" is a condition on
`R` only when the cast `ℕ → R` is injective — in characteristic `p` every element of `ZMod p` is
such a cast and the predicate would be satisfied by every tuple. That hypothesis is used in the
definition itself, through the injective `Nat.castEmbedding` rather than the bare `Nat.cast`, so
that no shape of the predicate can drift away from it; `TauCeti.isGlDominantIntegral_iff` puts the
condition back in the plain form `∃ k : ℕ, μ i - μ j = k`. The two statements that read a scalar
back off a vector — uniqueness of the weight, and that rescaling preserves the predicate — are the
ones needing more, namely the hypotheses `IsCancelMulZero R` and `Module.IsTorsionFree R M` of
Mathlib's `smul_left_injective`, without which a torsion vector could carry several weights at
once.

As in `TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/GeneralLinear/Basic.lean`, `LieRing.ofAssociativeRing` is a local
instance, Mathlib not registering it globally; the Lie module hypotheses on `M` are stated against
it, so a downstream file must install it too before mentioning `IsGlHighestWeightVector`.

`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`: *"dominance is a condition on
differences (`IsGlDominantIntegral`: consecutive differences in `ℕ`, entries free in `K`), and a
highest weight vector is a simultaneous eigenvector of the diagonal killed by the strict upper
triangle (`IsGlHighestWeightVector`)"*, together with the staircase example that item names and the
integral points of that layer's "dictionary to the group level". The classification statements
made against them are not proved here.

variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [CharZero R] {n : ℕ}

/-- A tuple `μ : Fin n → R` is **dominant integral** for `gl n` when each consecutive difference
`μ i - μ j`, `j` the successor of `i`, is a natural number.

The scalars are required to have characteristic zero: that is what makes the condition say what it
reads as. In characteristic `p` the cast `ℕ → R` is not injective — over `ZMod p` every element is
the cast of a natural number — so every tuple would be dominant and the notion would be vacuous.
Accordingly the cast is spelled through `Nat.castEmbedding`, which is `Nat.cast` bundled with its
injectivity, so that the hypothesis is used by the statement itself;
`TauCeti.isGlDominantIntegral_iff` restates the condition with the plain cast and is how the
predicate is introduced and eliminated.

The entries themselves are unconstrained: dominance is a condition on differences only, so it is
invariant under the central direction `μ ↦ μ + c · (1, …, 1)`
(`TauCeti.IsGlDominantIntegral.add_const`) and does not force integrality
(`TauCeti.glStaircase_ne_intCast`). -/

/-- **The highest root vector is a highest weight vector**, for the adjoint action of `gl n R` on
itself: the matrix unit `E_{⊥⊤}` in the corner is nonzero, the diagonal acts on it by
`ε_⊥ - ε_⊤`, and every raising matrix unit annihilates it, since `E_{ij} E_{⊥⊤}` needs `j = ⊥` and
`E_{⊥⊤} E_{ij}` needs `i = ⊤`, both impossible for `i < j`.

`TauCeti.IsGlHighestWeightVector` is therefore not vacuous. For an index type with more than one
element the weight `ε_⊥ - ε_⊤` is the highest root, the tuple `(1, 0, …, 0, -1)`; for a singleton
one the two matrix units coincide, the weight degenerates to `0`, and the statement is the (still
true) assertion that `E_{⊥⊥}` is a highest weight vector of weight `0` of the abelian `gl 1`. -/
