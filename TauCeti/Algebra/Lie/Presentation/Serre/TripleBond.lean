# Triple-bond Weyl normalization for Serre systems

At a directed Cartan entry minus three, the pinned Weyl unit sends the raising generator
to one sixth of its third raising bracket, and the lowering generator to minus one sixth
of its third lowering bracket. Both signs are needed to conjugate the Weyl representative
at the adjacent node, and hence to establish the triple-bond braid relation.

These are rational operator identities. They impose no faithfulness or nonvanishing on the
Serre system and divide by six only in the rational algebra, not in a value ring of positive
characteristic. The matrix convention is `⁅H i, E j⁆ = CM i j • E j`.

The formulas use the root-string calculations in
`TauCeti.Algebra.Lie.Sl2.Weyl.WeightThree`, as the double-bond formulas use `WeightTwo`.
