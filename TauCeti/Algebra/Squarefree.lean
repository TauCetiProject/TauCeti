# Squarefree elements and rational squares

This file records a few general facts about squarefree elements and rational squares that Mathlib
does not provide directly, used across the multiquadratic development.

* `Squarefree.not_isSquare`: a squarefree non-unit of a monoid is not a square (the converse of
  Mathlib's `IsUnit.squarefree`). It is phrased with `Squarefree` dot-notation, so a caller
  holding `ha : Squarefree a` and `hu : ¬ IsUnit a` can write `ha.not_isSquare hu`.
* `Squarefree.neg`: negation preserves squarefreeness in any ring with distributive negation.
* `not_isSquare_intCast_of_squarefree_of_ne_one`: a squarefree integer other than `1` is not a
  rational square.
* `isSquare_of_isSquare_four_mul`: dividing a rational square by `4` leaves a rational square.

/-- A squarefree integer other than `1` is not a rational square. If `(n : ℚ)` were a square then
`n = a * a` for some integer `a`; squarefreeness forces `a` to be a unit, so `n = 1`. -/
