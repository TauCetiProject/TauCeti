# Subalgebras over different base rings with the same underlying set

Mathlib's `Subalgebra.equivOfEq` identifies two equal subalgebras of an algebra `A` over one and
the same base ring `R`. Two subalgebras of `A` over *different* base rings cannot be equal, since
they live in different types, but they can still have the same underlying set, and then they are
the same subsemiring of `A`. This file records the resulting ring isomorphism, which is
`RingEquiv.subsemiringCongr` on the underlying subsemirings, together with the fact that it is
compatible with the two inclusions into `A`.

## Main results

* `Subalgebra.ringEquivOfSetEq`: the ring isomorphism between two subalgebras of `A`, over possibly
  different base rings, with the same underlying set.
* `Subalgebra.coe_ringEquivOfSetEq_apply` and `Subalgebra.coe_ringEquivOfSetEq_symm_apply`: the
  isomorphism and its inverse commute with the inclusions into `A`.

/-- Two subalgebras of `A`, over possibly different base rings, with the same underlying set are
isomorphic as rings: the identity of `A` restricted to that set. This is the counterpart of
`Subalgebra.equivOfEq` for subalgebras over different base rings, and is
`RingEquiv.subsemiringCongr` on the underlying subsemirings. -/
