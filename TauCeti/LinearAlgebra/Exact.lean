# Finiteness consequences of exact sequences

This file records two elementary consequences of exactness at the middle term: finite-dimensional
outer vector spaces (over a division ring) force the middle vector space to be finite-dimensional,
and trivial outer types force the middle type to be trivial. The second needs no algebraic
structure beyond a distinguished zero in each of the three types, which is already what
`Function.Exact` and the hypothesis `f 0 = 0` refer to.

/-- If `M --f--> N --g--> P` is exact at `N` and both `M` and `P` are finite-dimensional, then so
is `N`.

This is deduced from `Module.Finite.of_exact`, which asks the second map to be surjective, by
corestricting `g` to its range. -/
