# The determinant of an endomorphism of `R × R`

An endomorphism `A` of `R × R` is determined by the images `A (1, 0)` and `A (0, 1)` of the
standard basis vectors, and its determinant is the `2 × 2` determinant of these two columns. This
is `Matrix.det_fin_two` read through the basis `Module.Basis.finTwoProd R`. It is the Jacobian
determinant in the change of variables formula for maps of the plane `ℝ × ℝ`.
