# The four conjugacy normal forms of `GL₂` over a finite field

`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ConjugacyClasses.lean` classifies the conjugacy
classes of `GL₂(F)` by trace and determinant, with the companion matrix of the characteristic
polynomial as the representative of each non-scalar class. That representative is uniform but
anonymous. This file replaces it, over a finite field, by the four **named** normal forms the
character theory of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` is written against:

* a **central** scalar matrix `a • 1`;
* a **split semisimple** `TauCeti.diagGL ![a, b]` with `a ≠ b`;
* a **non-semisimple** Jordan block `TauCeti.jordanGL a 1`;
* an **elliptic** `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorusHom F E hE x`, multiplication by an element of a
  degree-`2` extension `E/F` that does not lie in `F`.

`TauCeti.exists_isConj_normalForm` is the resulting statement that every element of `GL₂(F)` is
conjugate to one of the four. It is what turns the four character values computed at these normal
forms in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/CharacterValues.lean` into a full row of
the character table of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`: a character is a class function, so a row is determined once the
normal forms exhaust the classes.

The two non-central split forms need no finiteness and no extension. Each is the same check
against `TauCeti.isConj_iff_of_notMem_range_scalar`: the normal form is not scalar, and its trace
and determinant are the prescribed ones. What the roots of `X² - t X + d` are is the only thing
that distinguishes them — two distinct roots give `diagGL`, a repeated root gives `jordanGL` —
and only in the repeated-root case need non-scalarness be assumed: a scalar matrix has a repeated
root, so prescribing two distinct roots, or a root outside `F`, already rules it out.

The elliptic case is the one that needs a quadratic extension, and it is where the finiteness of
`F` enters. Multiplication by `x : E` has trace `Tr_{E/F} x` and determinant `N_{E/F} x`
(`TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.trace_gl2NonSplitTorusHom` and
`TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.val_det_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`), so the normal form is pinned by the
quadratic-extension lemmas of `TauCeti/FieldTheory/Quadratic.lean`:
`TauCeti.Algebra.trace_eq_of_mul_self_eq` and `TauCeti.Algebra.norm_eq_of_mul_self_eq` identify
those with `t` and `d` for an `x` outside `F` satisfying `x² = t x - d`, and
`TauCeti.exists_mul_self_eq_of_finite` supplies such an `x` over a finite field.

Uniqueness — that the four families are pairwise disjoint and that the parameters are determined up
to the evident symmetries `(a, b) ↦ (b, a)` and `x ↦ x^q` — is a separate statement and is not
proved here; `TauCeti.conjClassesGLFinTwoEquiv` already indexes the classes without it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isConj_diagGL_of_trace_of_det`, `TauCeti.isConj_jordanGL_one_of_trace_of_det` and
  `TauCeti.isConj_gl2NonSplitTorusHom_of_trace_of_det`: **the three non-central normal forms**, each
  characterized by the roots of its characteristic polynomial, read off the trace and the
  determinant.
* `TauCeti.exists_isConj_normalForm`: **every element of `GL₂(F)`, for `F` finite with a degree-`2`
  extension `E`, is conjugate to one of the four normal forms.**
