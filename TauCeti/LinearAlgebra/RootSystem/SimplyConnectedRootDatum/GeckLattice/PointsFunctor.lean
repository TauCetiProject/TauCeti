# The points of the pinned Geck carrier, functorially in the value ring

`TauCeti.DynkinType.geckGroupScheme` is the explicit affine group scheme over `ℤ` attached to a
valid Dynkin type, and `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPoints` reads its `A`-valued points as a subgroup
of `GLₙ(A)`. Those point groups have so far been available one value ring at a time, together with
the single endomorphism induced by the `p ^ k`-power Frobenius. This file supplies the map induced
by an arbitrary homomorphism of value rings, and assembles the point groups into a functor.

The induced map is entrywise, so on the pinned generating families it acts by

```text
f (xᵢ(u)) = xᵢ(f u),        f (t(s)) = t(f ∘ s),
```

with `i` ranging over the numbered raising and lowering generators. Reading this at
`iterateFrobenius A p k` gives the `q`-power Frobenius endomorphism of the carrier, which
`TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.SimplyConnectedRootDatum.GeckLattice.Frobenius` defines as
exactly this map's value there.

Nothing here identifies the carrier's points with the elementary subgroup its root subgroups
generate; that needs a generation theorem which is not available. The Geck weights span the root
lattice rather than, in general, the full character lattice, so this carrier is not yet the simply
connected one a finite group of Lie type is built from. Nothing below asserts that any subgroup
appearing in it is finite, is simple, or is a named finite group.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsMap`: the group homomorphism on the points of the pinned Geck
  carrier induced by a homomorphism of value rings.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsFunctor`: the resulting group-valued functor on commutative
  `ℤ`-algebras.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsMulEquiv` and `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsFunctorNatIso`: the
  quotient of the general-linear coordinate Hopf algebra by the Geck defining ideal represents
  that functor, pointwise and naturally.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.coe_geckPointsMap`: the induced map is the entrywise one.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsMap_id` and `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsMap_comp`: the
  functoriality laws.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsMap_injective`: an injective homomorphism of value rings induces
  an injective map of points.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsMap_geckRootSubgroupPoints` and
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckPointsMap_geckWeightTorusPoints`: the equations on the pinned root
  subgroups and on the pinned weight torus.

This is the pinned instance of the target "points over an algebraically closed field as a group,
functorially in the field, so that a field endomorphism induces a group endomorphism of the points"
in Layer 9 of `TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`, whose carrier-independent half is
`TauCeti.GeneralLinear.hopfIdealPointsSubgroupFunctor`. Its consumer is milestone L0 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, which reads the carrier of a finite group of Lie type off
the points of a pinned Chevalley--Demazure group over an algebraic closure of `ZMod p`.
