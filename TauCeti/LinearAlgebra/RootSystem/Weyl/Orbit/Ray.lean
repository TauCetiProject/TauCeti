# Rays and translates of Weyl orbits of weights

Two facts about the Weyl orbit `W λ` of a weight `λ` of a root pairing over a linearly ordered
field. When the Weyl group is finite, no two distinct weights of `W λ` lie in the same ray, so a
vector in `W λ` is determined by its direction. Adding a weight `χ` fixed by the Weyl group maps
`W λ` into `W (λ + χ)`, since `w λ + χ = w (λ + χ)`.

These are the hypotheses under which a path with velocities in `W λ` has a unique distinguished
presentation, and its central shift by `χ` has velocities in `W (λ + χ)`; see
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/LSPath/Distinguished.lean`.

For a root pairing over `ℤ`, an additive map `f` from the weight lattice to a vector space carries
the reflection `s_i` in the root `αᵢ` to the reflection in `f αᵢ` along a linear form agreeing
with the coroot `αᵢ^∨`, so the image `f (W λ)` is stable under the latter. This is the hypothesis
under which the root operators preserve paths with velocities in `f (W λ)`; see
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/LSPath/OrbitStable.lean`.

## Main results

* `RootPairing.pairwise_not_sameRay_orbit_weylGroup`: when the Weyl group is finite, no two
  distinct weights of a Weyl orbit lie in the same ray.
* `RootPairing.mapsTo_add_orbit_weylGroup`: adding a Weyl-invariant weight `χ` maps `W λ` into
  `W (λ + χ)`.
* `RootPairing.mapsTo_preReflection_image_orbit_weylGroup`: the image `f (W λ)` of a Weyl orbit
  in a vector space is stable under the reflection in an image root `f αᵢ`, along a linear form
  agreeing with the coroot `αᵢ^∨`.
