# Unique finitely supported linear combinations

This file characterizes membership in the span of a linearly independent family by the existence
of a unique finitely supported linear combination.

## Main statements

* `LinearIndependent.mem_span_range_iff_existsUnique`: membership in the span of a
  linearly independent family is equivalent to having unique finitely supported coordinates.
