# Links and stars in abstract simplices

This file computes the closed star, link, and deletion constructions on the standard abstract
simplex and its boundary.  These formulas are the standard-model calculations used by the
recursive link condition for combinatorial manifolds in layer 11 of the geometric-topology
roadmap.  In particular, the link of a face in a simplex is the simplex on the complementary
vertices, while the link in the boundary is the boundary of that complementary simplex.

The constructions use `PreAbstractSimplicialComplex`, since taking a link changes the vertices
that occur.  The formulas follow Rourke--Sanderson, *Introduction to Piecewise-Linear Topology*,
Chapter 2.

## Main results

* `closedStar_simplex`: the closed star of a simplex face is the whole simplex.
* `link_simplex`: the link of a simplex face is the simplex on its complementary vertices.
* `deletion_simplex_self`: deleting the top face leaves the simplex boundary.
* `link_simplexBoundary`: the link of a boundary face is the boundary on its complementary
  vertices.
