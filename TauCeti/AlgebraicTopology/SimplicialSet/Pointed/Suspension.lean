# Suspension and loops of pointed simplicial sets

The simplicial suspension of a pointed simplicial set is its smash product with the simplicial
circle on the left.  Its right adjoint is the pointed mapping simplicial set out of that circle.
This file names these two functors and their adjunction, fixing the left-coordinate convention
used by spectra and reduced cohomology.

## Main definitions

* `PointedSSet.suspension`: the functor `X ↦ S¹ ∧ X`.
* `PointedSSet.loops`: the functor `Y ↦ Map_*(S¹, Y)`.
* `PointedSSet.suspensionLoopAdjunction`: the adjunction `S¹ ∧ - ⊣ Map_*(S¹, -)`.
