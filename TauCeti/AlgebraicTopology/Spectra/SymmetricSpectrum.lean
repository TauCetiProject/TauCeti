# The sphere symmetric sequence and symmetric spectra

The sphere sequence `n ↦ S^n = (S¹)^∧n`, with the coordinate-permutation actions of `Σ_n` and the
block-concatenation maps `S^p ∧ S^q → S^(p+q)`, is a braided monoidal functor out of the
finite-bijection groupoid (`PointedSSet.smashPowFunctor PointedSSet.circle`). Regarded as a
symmetric sequence, it is the monoid `SymmetricSequence.smashPow PointedSSet.circle` of smash
powers of the circle, and so a commutative monoid for the Day convolution product: its
multiplication `S ⊗ S ⟶ S` is induced by block concatenation of sphere coordinates
(`SymmetricSequence.smashPow_mul_app_smashMk`) and its unit by `S⁰ ≅ S^0`. Following Hovey,
Shipley and Smith, a symmetric spectrum is a module over this commutative monoid.

Unwinding the universal property of the Day convolution, a symmetric spectrum `X` amounts to a
symmetric sequence of pointed simplicial sets `X_n` with based `Σ_p × Σ_q`-equivariant structure
maps `S^p ∧ X_q → X_(p+q)`, compatible with the unit `S⁰ ≅ S^0` and with block concatenation of
spheres. These iterated structure maps and their laws are developed in
`TauCeti.CategoryTheory.Monoidal.DayConvolution.Module`, through the generic
`CategoryTheory.Mod.dayStructureMap` API.

As the sphere monoid is commutative and Day convolution is closed, symmetric spectra have internal
function spectra `Hom_S(X, Y) = (Mod.internalHom X).obj Y`: the equalizer of the two maps
`Hom(X, Y) ⇉ Hom(S ⊗ X, Y)` of internal homs of symmetric sequences given by the actions on `X`
and on `Y`, with the sphere acting through `X`. Spectrum maps `X ⊗ K ⟶ Y` out of the Day
convolution of `X` with a symmetric sequence `K` are the maps of symmetric sequences
`K ⟶ Hom_S(X, Y)` (`Mod.ihomAdjunction`).

The commutative sphere action also gives a native sphere bimodule via
`CategoryTheory.Mod.toBimod`: the right action is obtained by swapping the sphere and
spectrum factors before applying the left action. This adapter is fully faithful.

Through this adapter, symmetric spectra carry the smash product `X ∧ Y`, the balanced tensor
product over the sphere: the coequalizer of the two actions of `S` on the Day convolution `X ⊗ Y`,
with `S` acting through `X`. This is the generic monoidal structure
`CategoryTheory.Mod.monoidalCategory` on modules over a commutative monoid object, with quotient
map `CategoryTheory.Mod.tensorπ : X ⊗ Y ⟶ X ∧ Y`. Its unit is the sphere spectrum
`Mod.regular SymmetricSequence.sphere`. As symmetric sequences form a symmetric monoidal category,
the smash product is symmetric monoidal (`CategoryTheory.Mod.symmetricCategory`), with the twist
`X ∧ Y ≅ Y ∧ X` induced by the symmetry of the Day convolution; commutative monoids for it are
commutative symmetric ring spectra. This is the point-set smash product; deriving it requires
a model structure.

## Main definitions

* `SymmetricSequence.sphere`: the sphere symmetric sequence. Its commutative monoid structure is
  the instance `DayFunctor.monObj`, with commutativity `DayFunctor.isCommMonObj`.
* `SymmetricSpectrum`: symmetric spectra of pointed simplicial sets, the modules over
  `SymmetricSequence.sphere`.
