# Symmetric sequences of pointed simplicial sets

A symmetric sequence of pointed simplicial sets is a functor `X` from the finite-bijection
groupoid to pointed simplicial sets: a sequence of pointed simplicial sets `X_n`, the value at
the standard finite set `Fin n`, with a based action of the symmetric group `Σ_n` on each.

Symmetric sequences carry the Day convolution product along the block sum of finite sets. Its
`n`-th level is the left Kan extension
`(X ⊗ Y)_n = colim_{Fin p ⊕ Fin q ≃ Fin n} X_p ∧ Y_q`,
which Hovey, Shipley and Smith write as the wedge `⋁_{p+q=n} (Σ_n)₊ ∧_{Σ_p × Σ_q} (X_p ∧ Y_q)`
of induced representations; that identification is not formalized here. We define
`SymmetricSequence` as Mathlib's type synonym `FiniteBijection ⊛⥤ PointedSSet` carrying the Day
convolution monoidal structure, and check that the hypotheses of Mathlib's construction hold:

* pointed simplicial sets have all small colimits, as an undercategory of simplicial sets, so
  the Day convolution and its unit exist as pointwise left Kan extensions;
* the smash product of pointed simplicial sets is closed and symmetric, so smashing with a fixed
  pointed simplicial set on either side preserves colimits.

As the block sum on finite sets and the smash product are symmetric, Day convolution makes
symmetric sequences a symmetric monoidal category. Its unit is the zero sphere `S⁰` in level
zero and the point in every positive level: the instance `DayFunctor.isIso_ν` identifies level
zero with `S⁰`, and `SymmetricSequence.isInitialUnitObj` shows that each positive level, which
receives no bijection from `Fin 0`, is initial, that is, isomorphic to the one-point pointed
simplicial set.

Pointed simplicial sets are complete and closed, so this symmetric monoidal structure is closed:
the internal hom of symmetric sequences has levels
`Hom(X, Y)_n = ∫_k Map_*(X_k, Y_(k+n))`, the end over the finite-bijection groupoid. Hovey, Shipley
and Smith write it as the product `∏_k Map_{Σ_k}(X_k, Y_(k+n))` of equivariant mapping spaces; that
identification is not formalized here.

Symmetric spectra are the modules over the commutative monoid of spheres in this symmetric
monoidal category. Limits and colimits of symmetric sequences are computed levelwise, using the
equivalence `DayFunctor.equiv` with the underlying functor category. Day convolution preserves
colimits separately in each variable.

## Main definitions

* `SymmetricSequence`: symmetric sequences of pointed simplicial sets, with the Day convolution
  product.
* The symmetric monoidal structure on `SymmetricSequence`, the instance
  `DayFunctor.symmetricCategory`, and its closed structure, the instance
  `DayFunctor.monoidalClosed`.

## Main statements

* `SymmetricSequence.isInitialUnitObj`: the unit symmetric sequence is initial in every positive
  level.
