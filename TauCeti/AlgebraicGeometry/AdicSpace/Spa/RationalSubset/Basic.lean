# Rational subsets of the adic spectrum


**The set-level constructions beneath Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1),
Definition 7.29 and Remark 7.30.**

For a finite numerator set `T` and a denominator `s`, the rational subset is the trace on
`spa A⁺` of the basic open `Spv(A)(T/s)`:

```text
R(T/s) = {v ∈ spa A⁺ | v(t) ≤ v(s) ≠ 0 for every t ∈ T} = spa A⁺ ∩ Spv(A)(T/s).
```

As with `spa` itself, the definition is stated for arbitrary data: no hypothesis relates the
topology of `A` to its ring operations, the subring is arbitrary, and Wedhorn's standing
condition that the ideal `T · A` be open is not assumed. It is Wedhorn's rational subset of
`Spa (A, A⁺)` under his hypotheses (a Huber ring, a ring of integral elements, `T · A` open);
the open-ideal condition enters only in the results that need it — Wedhorn's admissibility
setting, the basis claims of Definition 7.29, and the quasi-compactness of Theorem 7.35. The
generalized unit-ideal standard-cover theorem itself requires no openness hypothesis.

The exported interface of the definition, the normalizations and the intersection identity
inherited from `Spv(A)(T/s)`, the whole-space case, containment in `spa A⁺`, and relative
openness in the subspace all hold with no extra hypotheses. The file also proves the forward
standard-cover implication of Corollary 7.53.

On the intersection identity, writing `Uᵢ = insert sᵢ Tᵢ` for each numerator set augmented by
its own denominator (which costs nothing, by `rationalSubset_insert_self`),

```text
R(T₁/s₁) ∩ R(T₂/s₂) = R(U₁U₂ / s₁s₂).
```

The augmentation is essential: with the bare products `T₁T₂` the identity is false — for
`T₁ = {t}` and `T₂ = ∅` the right-hand side would forget the condition `v(t) ≤ v(s₁)`. This
identity is the set-level half of Wedhorn's Remark 7.30(5); his full statement also says the
right-hand pair is again *admissible* (`U₁U₂ · A` open), which belongs to the open-ideal
layer deferred above.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.rationalSubset` : the rational subset `R(T/s)` of `spa A⁺`, as a
  `Set (Spv A)`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spaRationalOpen` : the same subset as an `Opens ↥(spa A⁺)` — the form
  a presheaf indexes on.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.rationalSubset_def` and
  `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.mem_rationalSubset_iff` : the set-level and membership-level
  characterizations — the definition is not exposed across the module boundary, so these two
  are the exported interface, as for `spa_def`/`mem_spa_iff`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.rationalSubset_subset_spa` : every rational subset is contained
  in the adic spectrum.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.rationalSubset_insert_self` : the denominator may be inserted
  among the numerators.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.rationalSubset_singleton_one` : the whole spectrum is the
  rational subset `R({1}/1)` — Wedhorn's "`Spa (A, A⁺)` itself is rational".
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.val_preimage_rationalSubset` : on the subtype `spa A⁺`, a
  rational subset is just the trace of its ambient basic open.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isOpen_val_preimage_rationalSubset` : a rational subset is
  relatively open in the subspace `spa A⁺`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.rationalSubset_inter` : the intersection identity above — the
  set-level half of Remark 7.30(5), and
  `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spaRationalOpen_inf` : its `Opens` companion, oriented the same way
  so the two layers share one `simp` normal form.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.coe_spaRationalOpen` and
  `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.mem_spaRationalOpen_iff` : the set-level and membership-level
  characterizations of `spaRationalOpen`. The body is sealed, so the membership one is the only
  route to `x ∈ spaRationalOpen …`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.exists_refinement_of_subset` : the re-presentation step of Wedhorn
  §8.2 — from `R(T'/s') ⊆ R(T/s)`, a presentation `R(T''/(s · s'))` of the smaller subset whose
  denominator has each original denominator as a factor and whose numerators contain `t · s'` for
  `t ∈ T` and `t' · s` for `t' ∈ T'`. Constructing a restriction map needs one further, algebraic
  input beyond these, the standing `HasDenominatorPower` hypothesis for the new pair, which this
  file does not supply.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spa_eq_biUnion_rationalSubset_of_span_eq_top` : a finite set
  generating the unit ideal gives a standard rational cover, the forward implication of
  Corollary 7.53.

  standalone `rationalOpen` and an existential `IsRationalSubset` predicate, with the
  intersection identity conditioned on each denominator lying in its numerator set and the
  same insert-absorption discharging that condition. Here the rational subset is instead the
  trace of the merged `Spv A`-level `basicOpenFinset`, so the identities are inherited from

/-- The rational subset `R(T/s)` of the adic spectrum: the trace on `spa A⁺` of the basic open
`Spv(A)(T/s)`. Under Wedhorn's hypotheses — a Huber ring, a ring of integral elements, and the
ideal `T · A` open — this is his Definition 7.29; the definition itself asks for none of them,
and the open-ideal condition matters only for results such as Wedhorn's admissibility setting
or the basis claims, not for the definition nor the generalized unit-ideal cover. -/
def rationalSubset (Aplus : Subring A) (T : Finset A) (s : A) : Set (Spv A) :=

/-- The set-level characterization of a rational subset. The definition is not exposed across
the module boundary, so this equation is how consumers apply set-level results to
`rationalSubset` — for instance `rationalSubset_def _ _ _ ▸ Set.inter_subset_left` for the
containment in `spa A⁺`, which `rationalSubset_subset_spa` records. -/

/-- **The containment criterion for rational subsets.** One rational subset is contained in
another exactly when, at every point of the smaller, the larger one's numerators are dominated
by its denominator and that denominator is off the support.

Containment in `spa A⁺` is automatic on both sides, so it drops out of the criterion: only the
`T`-over-`s` conditions are left to check. This is the set-level input to Wedhorn's comparison of
two presentations (§8.2) — it says *which* valuation-theoretic facts a containment gives you,
leaving the passage from those facts to invertibility of `s` and power-boundedness of `t/s` in
the coordinate ring as a separate, genuinely algebraic step. -/

This is the pointwise companion of `spaRationalOpens` (`RationalSubset/Basis.lean`), which is the
*family* of such opens as a `Set (Opens _)` and cannot name the open a particular `(T, s)`

the open does not need. `spaRationalOpen_mem_spaRationalOpens` there is the bridge. -/

(`rationalSubset_insert_self`) and is essential — with the bare products the identity fails
for `T₂ = ∅`. Wedhorn's full Remark 7.30(5) additionally says the right-hand pair is again
admissible; that lives with the deferred open-ideal layer. This identity is the form Theorem

/-! ### Re-presenting a contained rational subset -/

open scoped Classical Pointwise in
/-- **A containment of rational subsets yields a presentation of the smaller one over the product
denominator.** If `R(T'/s') ⊆ R(T/s)` then `R(T'/s')` has a presentation `R(T''/(s · s'))` whose
numerators contain `t · s'` for every `t ∈ T` and `t' · s` for every `t' ∈ T'`.

The denominator is the point: it is divisible by `s`, so in a localisation presented by this pair
`s` is invertible by construction, and each numerator condition makes the fractions of one of the
two original presentations distinguished fractions of the new one. Those are the *set-level* inputs
a restriction map `A⟨T/s⟩ → A⟨T''/(s · s')⟩` is built from, and this is the re-presentation step of
Wedhorn §8.2.

**They are not by themselves enough to construct that map.** A presentation also carries the
standing hypothesis `HasDenominatorPower` for the new pair, an algebraic obligation about the ideal
of definition that this file does not supply — nothing here mentions coordinate rings at all.

Both numerator conditions are given rather than only the one for `T`, because discharging that
standing hypothesis for a product denominator needs the fractions of *each* factor; a consumer
holding one alone could not use it. -/
