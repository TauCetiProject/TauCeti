# The tensor product of `𝒪ₓ`-modules on a scheme

The site-level sheafified tensor product of sheaves of modules
(`TauCeti/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/TensorProduct/Basic.lean`) specializes to a scheme
`X` by taking the sheaf of commutative rings to be the structure sheaf of `X`.

## Main declarations

* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.tensorProduct` is the tensor product of two
  `𝒪ₓ`-modules on a scheme; its congruence, unit, and symmetry isomorphisms are the
  site-level ones of `TauCeti.SheafOfModules`.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/JacobianChallenge/README.md`, Layer A, item "Invertible
sheaves on a scheme; the Picard group `Pic X` under `⊗`": the tensor product is the
operation from which the Picard group will be built.
