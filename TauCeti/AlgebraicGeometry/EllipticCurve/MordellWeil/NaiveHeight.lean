# The naïve height on an elliptic curve, and the approximate parallelogram law

For an affine point `P` of a Weierstrass curve over a field `K` with a theory of heights, the
*naïve height* is `h(P) = logHeight (x(P))`, the logarithmic height of the projective
`x`-coordinate `P.xRep`. The main result is the **approximate parallelogram law**,

```text
∃ C, ∀ P Q, |h(P + Q) + h(P - Q) - 2 * (h(P) + h(Q))| ≤ C,
```

which is the height half of the descent proving the Mordell–Weil theorem. Together with the
Northcott property it gives finiteness of the sets of points of bounded naïve height.

The route is the one the source takes: the unordered pair `{P, Q}` is recorded by the symmetric
function `sym2x P Q` of the two `x`-coordinates, the map `{P, Q} ↦ {P + Q, P - Q}` is induced on
those symmetric functions by the quadratic `addSubMap`, and the height of a value of a
homogeneous polynomial map is controlled by the height of its argument. The commuting square
holds only up to a nonzero scalar, which is harmless because `logHeight` is scale-invariant.

Everything this runs on mentions no height and lives under `Affine/`: the commuting square in
`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Affine.AddSubMap`; the duplication formulae and the
`x`-coordinate addition formulae in `Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Affine.Formula`; and
their transport to `Point.xRep` and finiteness of the fibres of `xRep`, which the Northcott
instance consumes, in `Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.Affine.Point`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.naiveHeight` : the naïve height `logHeight P.xRep`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.approx_parallelogram_law` : the approximate parallelogram law.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finite_naiveHeight_le` : finiteness of points of bounded naïve height.

## Relation to Mathlib, and the duplication risk, weighed

The infrastructure this rests on is Mathlib's and is *consumed*, not restated: `Point.xRep`,
`addSubMap`, `addSubMapCoeff`, `isHomogeneous_addSubMap` and `sym2x`, the height API, and in
particular `abs_logHeight_addSubMap_sub_two_mul_logHeight_le`, the polynomial-map height bound the
parallelogram law consumes.

That last lemma lives in `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Height/EllipticCurve.lean`, a file by the same
author as this development's source, whose module docstring is titled "The naïve height and the
approximate parallelogram law" and whose `TODO` list names three items: define the naïve height,
add the further ingredients for the approximate parallelogram law, and add the law itself. The
`xRep` half of that programme has landed (Mathlib PR `#40303`, the duplication formulae and the
fibre finiteness now consumed from Mathlib above); the height half has not. So the declarations
here are work the upstream author has slotted but not landed: at the Mathlib version this
repository pins, they are absent, which is why they are stated here rather than imported.

This is a deliberate, temporary duplication with a defined end. If a later pin bump lands that
upstream work, the superseded declarations here must be deleted and their uses repointed at
Mathlib in the same pull request, per this repository's no-compatibility-shims rule.

whose own proof uses the discriminant unit `W.Δ'⁻¹`, an object that exists only for an elliptic
