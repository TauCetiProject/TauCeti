# Pointedness at the place at infinity

An isogeny of affine Weierstrass curves is a coordinate pullback `φ : R(W₂) → K(W₁)` carrying the
integrality condition `MapsInfinity`, the algebraic form of `φ(O₁) = O₂`. This file reads that
condition off as a statement about **places**: restricting the place at infinity of `W₁` along the
function-field pullback gives the place at infinity of `W₂`,

`((W₁.infinityPlace).comap φ.fieldPullback).IsEquiv W₂.infinityPlace`.

The proof is the pole of `x`. Suppose the pulled-back coordinate `φ x₂` had no pole at `O₁`. The
Weierstrass equation of `W₂`, pulled back, then forces `φ y₂` to have no pole either — a pole of
`φ y₂` would make the left-hand side dominate a right-hand side of value at most `1` — so the whole
image `φ(R(W₂))` lies in the valuation ring at infinity of `W₁`. That ring is integrally closed,
so `MapsInfinity` puts `x₁` in it as well, contradicting the double pole `v_∞ x₁ = exp 2`. Hence
`φ x₂` has a pole at `O₁`, and
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isEquiv_infinityPlace_of_one_lt` identifies the restricted valuation.

Conversely, a bare function-field embedding is a pointed coordinate pullback when it carries the
place at infinity to the place at infinity. The proof uses
`TauCeti.isIntegral_of_forall_valuation_le_one`: a valuation bounded on the pulled-back coordinate
ring is either trivial, or its proper valuation subring is the ring of a place. If the source
coordinate had a pole there, uniqueness would identify that place with infinity, contradicting
boundedness of the pulled-back target coordinate. This makes the source coordinate integral;
integrality of the coordinate ring over the polynomial ring then gives `MapsInfinity`.

Neither direction uses ellipticity, separability, or the degree of an isogeny.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.one_lt_infinityPlace_pullback_X`: **the pulled-back coordinate has a pole at
  infinity**, `1 < v_∞ (φ x₂)`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.isEquiv_comap_infinityPlace`: **the place at infinity restricts to the place at
  infinity** along an isogeny.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.comap_infinityPlace_apply_algebraMap`: the restricted valuation, evaluated on
  the image of the target coordinate ring, is `v_∞ ∘ φ` — the computation rule the other two are
  stated through.
* `TauCeti.CoordinatePullback.mapsInfinity_iff_one_lt_infinityPlace`: **pointedness is exactly a
  pole of `x` at infinity**, the form in which a construction can establish it by one valuation
  computation.
* `TauCeti.CoordinatePullback.mapsInfinity_iff_isEquiv_comap_infinityPlace`: **the pointedness
  criterion**, `MapsInfinity σ ↔ σ_*(O₁) = O₂`, for an embedding `σ` of function fields.

## Roadmap

`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, **Layer 1**, whose dual-isogeny milestone asks for "an
unpointed induced-place map for finite function-field embeddings, with the named criterion
`MapsInfinity λ ↔ λ_*(O₂) = O₃`, and functoriality of induced places along `λ ∘ φ = ψ` — which
yields `λ_*(O₂) = λ_*(φ_*(O₁)) = ψ_*(O₁) = O₃` at the level of places, *then* `λ` is packaged".
This file supplies both the named criterion and the direction it applies to `φ` and to `ψ`: an
isogeny pushes the place at infinity forward to the place at infinity. It is also the Layer-0
`inducedPlace` of `W₁.infinityPlace` along an isogeny, computed.
