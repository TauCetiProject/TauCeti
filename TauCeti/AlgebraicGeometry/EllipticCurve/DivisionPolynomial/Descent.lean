# Integrality descends along multiplication by `n`

If `n • P` has integral coordinates then so does `P`. This is the descent step of the
Nagell–Lutz argument: it lets an integrality claim about a torsion point be pulled back from a
multiple where it is easier to establish.

The mechanism is one identity between the two `x`-coordinates. `zsmul_eq_smulEval` gives the
Jacobian coordinates of `n • P` as `(φₙ : ωₙ : ψₙ)` evaluated at `P`, and comparing that with the
affine representative of `n • P` yields `x' · ΨSqₙ(x) = Φₙ(x)`. That exhibits `x` as a root of the
**monic** polynomial `Φₙ − C x' · ΨSqₙ`, so integral closure places `x` in `R`, and the curve
equation carries integrality from `x` to `y`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.eval_mul_ΨSq_eq_eval_Φ_of_zsmul`: the coordinate identity
  `x' · ΨSqₙ(x) = Φₙ(x)` relating `P` and `n • P`, over a field.
* `TauCeti.WeierstrassCurve.isInteger_of_zsmul_isInteger`: **the descent step.** Over a UFD with
  fraction field `K`, if `n • P = P'` and `P'` has integral `x`-coordinate, both coordinates of
  `P` are integral.

## Roadmap

New mathematics: `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:821` — "**The torsion subgroup and
Nagell–Lutz**", route "division polynomials" (`:830`–`:831`). This is the descent half of that
route; it is a prerequisite of the roadmap's stated theorem rather than the theorem itself.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu and D. K. Angdinata's
`projects/NagellLutz/LutzNagell/LutzNagellTheorem/PIDIntegralMultiple.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main @ 1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`):
`x_coord_nsmul_eq` (`:48`) and `isInteger_of_nsmul_isInteger` (`:93`). The file is byte-identical
at `9fec8eba7652`, the revision the roadmap pins for this project (`README:1072`), verified by
blob hash, so the citations hold at either.

The source's intermediate `x_isInteger_of_nsmul_x_isInteger` (`:73`) is **not ported**: it is the
composition of the coordinate identity above with the integral-root argument, and this repository
already carries the latter as `Integral.lean`'s `isInteger_of_mul_eval_ΨSq_eq_eval_Φ` — whose own
docstring notes that "no point, and no multiple, occurs in this statement", i.e. it is exactly the
point-free half. The composition is inlined here rather than given a name.

Two adaptations. `curveK R K W` is `W.map (algebraMap R K)`, which is `rfl`-equal to Mathlib's
`W.baseChange K`; this file uses `baseChange`, matching `Integral.lean` and `Integrality.lean`.
The source's `hn : n ≠ 0`, `hn_R : (n : R) ≠ 0` and `_hy'` hypotheses are dropped — none is used
by the proof once the integral-root step is delegated, and `_hy'` is unused upstream too.
