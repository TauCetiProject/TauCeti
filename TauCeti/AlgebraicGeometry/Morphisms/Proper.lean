# Proper morphisms of affine schemes

A morphism of affine schemes `Spec S ⟶ Spec R` is proper exactly when `S` is a finite
`R`-module. This is the affine case of Mathlib's characterization of finite morphisms as the
proper affine ones (`AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite.iff_isProper_and_isAffineHom`), combined with
the description of finite morphisms of affine schemes
(`AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite.SpecMap_iff`).

For example, the affine line `Spec R[t] ⟶ Spec R` over a nonzero ring is not proper, since
`R[t]` is not a finite `R`-module.
