# Flat morphisms satisfy fpqc descent

A morphism whose base change along a surjective, flat and quasi-compact morphism is flat is
itself flat. The affine statement is the descent of flatness of a module along a faithfully
flat extension of scalars (`RingHom.Flat.codescendsAlong_faithfullyFlat`), and Mathlib's
`AlgebraicGeometry.HasRingHomProperty.descendsAlong_flat` globalizes it.
