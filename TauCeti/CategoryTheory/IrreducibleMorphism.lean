# Irreducible morphisms

A morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` is **irreducible** when it is neither a split monomorphism nor a split
epimorphism, and every factorization `f = g ≫ h` has `g` a split mono or `h` a split epi. So `f`
admits no "genuine" intermediate object: any object `Z` it factors through contains `X` as a
retract, split off by the first factor `g : X ⟶ Z`, or contains `Y` as a retract, split off by
the second factor `h : Z ⟶ Y`.

Irreducible morphisms are what the arrows of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a finite-dimensional
algebra record. An arrow there is not an individual irreducible morphism: what governs the arrows
from `[X]` to `[Y]` is the space of irreducible morphisms `X ⟶ Y`, the quotient
`rad(X, Y) / rad²(X, Y)`, which is a bimodule over the division rings `End(Y) / rad End(Y)` and
`End(X) / rad End(X)`. Over an algebraically closed field those division rings are the field
itself, and then the arrows represent a basis, so their number is the dimension of that space;
over a general field the quiver is a valued one, carrying the two one-sided dimensions of the
bimodule instead. The middle term of an almost-split sequence is glued to its ends by
irreducible morphisms. Nothing in the definition is special to modules, so this file develops the
notion for an arbitrary category and specializes only where the statement forces it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism`: the definition, with `TauCeti.isIrreducibleMorphism_iff`
  spelling out its three clauses as the introduction and elimination rule.
* `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.not_isIso`: an irreducible morphism is not an isomorphism.
* `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.comp_iso` and `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.iso_comp`,
  with the `iff` forms `TauCeti.isIrreducibleMorphism_comp_iso_iff` and
  `TauCeti.isIrreducibleMorphism_iso_comp_iff`: irreducibility only depends on the morphism up to
  isomorphisms of its source and target, so it descends to the arrows of a skeleton.
* `TauCeti.not_isIrreducibleMorphism_zero`: **a zero morphism is never irreducible**, and its
  contrapositive `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.ne_zero`.
* `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.mono_or_epi`: **an irreducible morphism of a category with
  equalizers and images is a monomorphism or an epimorphism**, and by
  `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.not_mono_and_epi` never both in a balanced category, so there,
  as in an abelian category, `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.mono_iff_not_epi` is a genuine
  dichotomy.

Two general facts about split morphisms and composition are proved on the way and stated for
reuse: `TauCeti.isSplitMono_of_isSplitMono_comp` and `TauCeti.isSplitEpi_of_isSplitEpi_comp`.
Mathlib has the composition direction (a composite of split monos is a split mono) but not these
cancellation directions.

## Implementation notes

The definition is a conjunction rather than a structure, matching the signature pinned by the
roadmap; the three components are available as `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.not_isSplitMono`,
`TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.not_isSplitEpi` and `TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.factors`, so
that no proof has to project through `And` by hand. The body of the definition is not exposed
outside this module, so `⟨_, _, _⟩` is not available to establish it downstream;
`TauCeti.isIrreducibleMorphism_iff` is the introduction rule.

The quantifier in the third component ranges over *all* objects of the ambient category. For the
Auslander-Reiten theory of a finite-dimensional algebra that is the intended reading: the ambient
category there is already the finite-dimensional one (compare the finiteness side conditions that
the roadmap's `IsAlmostSplit` carries, which are needed because the lifting properties of an
almost-split sequence are *not* stable under enlarging the category, whereas the condition here
is a factorization property of a single morphism and so is simply inherited by any full
subcategory containing `X` and `Y`).

The dichotomy `mono_or_epi` is proved by feeding the image factorization `f = e ≫ i` to the
definition: `e` is epi (the category has equalizers), so if it splits it is an isomorphism and `f`
is mono; `i` is mono, so if it splits it is an isomorphism and `f` is epi.

## References

This implements the `IsIrreducibleMorphism` target of Layer 6 (Auslander-Reiten theory) of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`, stated there for
representations of a quiver; the definition below is the same one for a general category, and
instantiating `C` at `TauCeti.QuiverRep k Q` returns the pinned signature.

/-- **An irreducible morphism**: one that is neither a split monomorphism nor a split

The two negative clauses are what makes the notion nonvacuous: without them every isomorphism
would qualify. With them, an irreducible morphism is in particular not an isomorphism
(`TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.not_isIso`) and not zero
(`TauCeti.IsIrreducibleMorphism.ne_zero`). -/
