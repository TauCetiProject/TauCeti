# Restricting twisted objects to sets of summands

Let `T = (⊕ᵢ Xᵢ, δ)` be a twisted object of the additive closure of a differential graded category
`E`, and let `q` be a predicate on its summands.  The entries of the restricted matrix
`(δᵢⱼ)_{q i, q j}` satisfy the Maurer–Cartan equation as soon as no path `Xᵢ ⟶ Xₖ ⟶ Xⱼ` of two
entries of `δ` leaves the summands satisfying `q` and comes back, that is
`δᵢₖ` followed by `δₖⱼ` vanishes whenever `q i`, `q j` and `¬ q k`.  The restriction
`TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.restrict` is then the twisted object `(⊕_{q i} Xᵢ, δ|_q)`.

The main case is a predicate `p` such that `δ` has no entry from a summand satisfying `p` to one
which does not.  Both `p` and its complement then satisfy the condition above: the summands
satisfying `p` span a twisted sub-object `P`, those not satisfying `p` a twisted quotient `Q`, and
the remaining entries of `δ`, from the summands of `Q` to those of `P`, form a closed degree-one
morphism `g : Q ⟶ P` (`TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.restrictHom`).  Regrouping the summands identifies
`T` with the extension of `Q` by `P` along `g`, by mutually inverse closed degree-zero morphisms
whose entries are identities (`TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.extensionRestrictIso`).  For a one-sided
twisted complex and `p` the summands other than one of maximal level, this exhibits the twisted
complex as an extension of a single summand by a one-sided twisted complex with fewer summands;
see `TauCeti/CategoryTheory/DG/Twisted/OneSided.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.restrictTwist`: the restricted twisting matrix `δ|_q`.
* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.restrict`: the restriction of a twisted object of the additive closure
  to the summands satisfying a predicate.
* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.restrictHom`: the degree-one morphism from the summands not satisfying
  `p` to those satisfying `p`, made of the remaining entries of the twist.
* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.toExtensionRestrict` and
  `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.ofExtensionRestrict`: the regrouping morphisms between `T` and the
  extension of its restriction to `¬ p` by its restriction to `p`.
* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.extensionRestrictIso`: the induced isomorphism in the homotopy
  category.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.dgDifferential_restrictTwist`: the Maurer–Cartan equation of the
  restricted twisting matrix.
* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.dgHomEquiv_twist_restrict`: the twist of a restriction is the
  restricted matrix.
* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.dgDifferential_restrictHom`: the connecting morphism is closed.
* `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.dgDifferential_toExtensionRestrict`,
  `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.dgComp_toExtensionRestrict_ofExtensionRestrict` and
  `TauCeti.DGTwistedObject.dgComp_ofExtensionRestrict_toExtensionRestrict`: the regrouping
  morphisms are closed and mutually inverse.
