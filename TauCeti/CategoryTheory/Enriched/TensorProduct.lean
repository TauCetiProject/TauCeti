# Products and tensor products of enriched categories

If `C` is enriched in `V` and `D` is enriched in `W`, then `C × D` is enriched in the product
monoidal category `V × W`: Hom objects, identities and composition are taken componentwise.

When `C` and `D` are both enriched in a braided monoidal category `V`, the tensor product functor
`MonoidalCategory.tensor V : V × V ⥤ V` is monoidal, and transporting the `V × V`-enrichment of
`C × D` along it gives the tensor product of the two `V`-categories. Its Hom object from `(X, Y)`
to `(X', Y')` is `(X ⟶[V] X') ⊗ (Y ⟶[V] Y')`, its identities are tensor products of identities,
and its composition first applies the middle-four interchange `MonoidalCategory.tensorμ`, which
uses the braiding, and then composes in each factor. For categories enriched in cochain complexes
the braiding carries the Koszul sign, and this is the tensor product of differential graded
categories.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.prodEnrichedCategory`: the `V × W`-enrichment of `C × D`.
* `TauCeti.tensorEnrichedCategory`: the `V`-enrichment of `C × D` when `V` is braided.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.eHom_tensor_eq`, `TauCeti.eId_tensor_eq` and `TauCeti.eComp_tensor_eq`: Hom objects,
  identities and composition of the tensor product, in terms of those of the two factors.
