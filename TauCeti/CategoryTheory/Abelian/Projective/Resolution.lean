# Construction and comparison of projective resolutions

Mathlib compares two projective resolutions `P` and `Q` of the same object `X` by the lift of the
identity of `X` (`CategoryTheory.ProjectiveResolution.homotopyEquiv`), which it constructs
abstractly from the projectivity of the terms. Often one has an explicit chain map
`f : P.complex ⟶ Q.complex` instead, compatible with the augmentations. Such an `f` is itself a
lift of the identity of `X`, so it is homotopic to Mathlib's comparison
(`CategoryTheory.ProjectiveResolution.homotopyOfComm`) and is a homotopy equivalence
(`CategoryTheory.ProjectiveResolution.homotopyEquivOfComm`).

`ChainComplex.toProjectiveResolution` packages an augmented projective chain complex
which is exact in positive degrees and exact at its augmentation. Its quasi-isomorphism proof
is adapted from Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.ProjectiveResolution.of`, by Markus Himmel,
Kim Morrison, Jakob von Raumer and Joël Riou.
