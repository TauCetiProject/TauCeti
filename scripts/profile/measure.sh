# Runs INSIDE the landrun sandbox (offline, no token, writes confined to
# base/.lake). For every prepared Lean source under <prep>/src, elaborate it
# with Mathlib's countHeartbeats linter and write the linter's output next to
# it as <name>.hb. The library has already been built by the caller, so a
# file's imports resolve from the built oleans and only these single files are
# re-elaborated (out of tree, like Lean Pool's proof profiler).
#
# Advisory: a file that fails to elaborate records the failure in its own .hb
# log (the caller's render step reports it) and never fails this script, so one
# bad file cannot sink the whole profile.
#
# Usage: measure.sh <prep-dir>   (with the working directory at the built base)
