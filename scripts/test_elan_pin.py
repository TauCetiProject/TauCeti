"""Ensure every workflow that installs elan installs the same verified binary.

Run with: python3 scripts/test_elan_pin.py

elan chooses the `lake` and `lean` a job runs, so whoever controls the elan a workflow installs
controls what that job executes. That matters most in ci.yml's `publish-lake-cache` job, which
hands LAKE_CACHE_KEY to a `lake` the installer selected, and in pr-build.yml, where elan is
installed in the trusted phase before bwrap confines anything. So every workflow takes elan
from a pinned leanprover/elan release verified by SHA-256, and none of them runs the installer
served at https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh, whose contents are whatever that host returns
at the moment of the request.

The pin is deliberately duplicated across workflows rather than shared through a composite
action, for the same reason bwrap's is: pr-build.yml sits on the merge queue's critical path
and runs from the base definition under pull_request_target, so a shared action introduced by a
pull request could not be exercised by that pull request's own build. This test is what stops
the copies drifting.

The checks below match the install as a single ordered block of adjacent lines, over a view of
the file with comment lines removed, and then require that nothing else in the file names the
archive or the installer. Counting the pieces separately would have let a commented-out or
otherwise dead copy of the approved block pay for a live step that installed elan some other
way. Both .yml and .yaml are scanned, since GitHub reads either, and every file in the directory
is scanned rather than a fixed list, so a workflow added later cannot quietly reintroduce the
unpinned install.

What this cannot do is recognise an arbitrary new way to obtain an elan; no textual check can.
It fixes the approved shape and closes the routes that were actually in use.

To bump the pin, change ELAN_VER and ELAN_SHA256 together in every workflow that declares them;
the checksum is that of the release's elan-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz asset.
