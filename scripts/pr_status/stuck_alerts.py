"""Post *stuck-automation* alerts to a dedicated Zulip topic (Tau Ceti > Stuck PRs).

This is an EMERGENCY channel, not a "ask the humans for help" queue. Every alert
here means a piece of Tau Ceti's own automation was supposed to make progress and
could not unstick itself: a bump that will not cross a breaking change, a green PR
the merge machinery never merged, a scheduled job that stopped firing, main gone
red. The expected response to any alert is to FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE, e.g. a
script, a workflow, a pin, or a guard, so that the situation cannot recur. Do not
hand-hold one PR and move on. If an alert can only ever be resolved by a human
doing a one-off favour, it does not belong here; see the "deliberately NOT
alerted" list below.

Detectors (each names the infra failure it implies):

  1. stuck-bump      The last-known-good bump PR (branch hopscotch/lkg-bump) has a
                     RED `build` check that has stayed red past a grace window. The
                     daily bump cannot cross a mathlib breaking change on its own;
                     something needs a fix, e.g. a proof, scripts/lint-env.sh, or a
                     guard.
  2. stale-pin       main's mathlib pin has not moved in several days. The bump has
                     stopped advancing, e.g. a wedged PR, an unresolved
                     first-known-bad freeze, or update.yml silently broken.
  3. stranded-pr     A PR that is in-scope (TauCeti/ + allowed roots, bump-guard
                     green for any pin change), `build` green, every blocking
                     rubric green at HEAD, not draft/hold, mergeable, and quiet for
                     the grace window. auto-merge / the queue / merge-sweep broke.
  4. review-stuck    An open `Review stuck: PR #N` issue whose PR #N is also still
                     open: the review engine self-flagged a PR it cannot resolve.
                     An issue left open after its PR merged or closed is stale
                     bookkeeping by the (out-of-repo) worker, not a live wedge.
  5. dead-scheduler  A scheduled workflow is missing, disabled, or its last
                     SCHEDULED run is older than its cadence + slack. GitHub
                     disabled the cron (60-day inactivity), or it errors at dispatch.
  6. main-red        The CI run for main's tip commit reached a non-success terminal
                     conclusion. The "main is always green" invariant is broken.
  7. stale-fkb       An open first-known-bad issue (label `dependency-incompatibility`)
                     has been open past a grace window. A regression against TauCeti
                     nobody has landed the fix for.
  8. eviction-loop   The merge queue has accepted and evicted the same green PR
                     repeatedly. One eviction looks like nothing (merge-sweep just
                     re-enqueues), so only the count reveals a broken merge-group
                     build, e.g. a flaky cache.
  9. missing-status  A concluded pr-build left an open PR's head with no `build`
                     status. The PR is BLOCKED forever and its label is pinned at
                     `awaiting-CI`; nothing re-runs pr-build without a push.
 10. diverged-head   A PR's recorded head is not its branch tip, so GitHub never
                     recomputes mergeability and it sits at `mergeable: null`,
                     invisible to every mergeability-gated path.

Deliberately NOT alerted (normal backlog, not stuck automation -- alerting on
these would cheapen the topic and train people to ignore it):
  * a PR awaiting its first review verdict -- CI review generation is off by
    default (CI_REVIEW_ENABLED); reviews are run by humans / the worker on their
    own cadence, so "no verdict yet" is expected, not stuck;
  * a PR with changes-requested that nobody addressed -- housekeeping.py retires
    these after STALE_DAYS;
  * open roadmap / help-wanted issues -- that IS the ask-the-humans queue.

Idempotent, like zulip.py: exactly one bot-owned message per active
alert key, tagged with a hidden `<!--stuck:v1 <key>-->` marker on its LAST line.
Each run reconciles the topic against live GitHub state:
  * a NEW alert posts a message (the only event that notifies watchers);
  * an ONGOING alert is left byte-identical, so a persisting emergency is not
    re-edited every hour (bodies carry no live counters, only stable thresholds);
  * a CLEARED alert has its message edited to a ✅ form (edits do not notify);
  * a RECURRENCE (an alert whose latest message is already ✅) posts a NEW message
    rather than editing the buried one, so a re-fired incident is actually seen.
There are no @-mentions (the topic is watched, not pinged).

FAIL CLOSED, never fail open. A detector may raise, e.g. on a GitHub outage, a rate
limit, or a bug. When it does, its alerts are NOT cleared: its key-prefix is marked
"unknown" for the run and existing messages under that prefix are left exactly as
they are. The alternative
-- treating "the check failed" as "the emergency is over" -- is the worst possible
behaviour for a watchdog. Only a genuinely-absent alert from a detector that ran
cleanly is resolved.

Run status mirrors the healthcheck philosophy: the ALERTS are the signal, not the
run's red/green, so a run that checks and posts exits 0 even with ten alerts open.
Only a persistent Zulip CONFIG break (bad key, forbidden bot, not subscribed --
verified up front via zulip.check) fails the run loudly: if we cannot
post, the emergency channel itself is down, and that must not be silent.

Usage:
    stuck_alerts.py            # reconcile all detectors against the topic
    stuck_alerts.py --dry-run  # print the alerts it would post; touch no Zulip

Environment:
    ZULIP_API_KEY, ZULIP_EMAIL, ZULIP_SITE   bot credentials (required unless --dry-run)
    ZULIP_CHANNEL                            default "Tau Ceti"
    ZULIP_TOPIC                              default "Stuck PRs"
    GH_REPO                                  default "TauCetiProject/TauCeti"
    GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN                  used by `gh` for the GitHub API

Only python3's standard library and an authenticated `gh` CLI are required. The
Zulip client, credential handling, and sanitizer are reused from zulip.py
(same package dir); pointing that client at a different topic is the module's own
documented mechanism: ZULIP_TOPIC (set to "Stuck PRs" by the workflow) is read at
import, so send/find target this topic.
