# PR status mirroring

Surface where every TauCeti PR sits in the pipeline, in two places, from one
source of truth:

- **GitHub labels**: exactly one status label on each open PR, visible in the PR
  list and searchable.
- **Zulip reactions**: one bot-owned message per PR in the **Tau Ceti** channel,
  carrying emoji that track the same states at a glance.

[`core.py`](core.py) is that source of truth. It derives a PR's status from
GitHub (PR state, the `build` commit status, the canonical
`<!--tauceti-scoreboard-->` comment's meta JSON, and the review engine's
`<!--tauceti-review-in-progress-->` marker) and returns a neutral
`{lifecycle, ci, review, review_inprogress}`. It writes nothing. The two *sinks*
import it and only differ in how they render that one status, so labels and
reactions can never disagree:

| `core.derive` | `labels.py` (one label) | `zulip.py` (two reaction groups) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lifecycle `merged` / `closed` | *(no label)* | `:merge:` / `:closed-pr:` |
| ci `running` | `awaiting-CI` | 🟡 `yellow` |
| ci not reported | `awaiting-CI` | 🟡 `yellow` |
| ci `failure` | `awaiting-author` | 🔴 `red_circle` |
| ci `success`, review `changes` | `awaiting-author` | 🟢 + ✍️ `writing` |
| ci `success`, review `approved` | `ready-to-merge` | 🟢 + ✔️ `check` |
| ci `success`, review pending, live marker | `review-in-progress` | 🟢 + 👀 |
| ci `success`, review pending, no marker | `awaiting-review` | 🟢 |

Both review signals (the scoreboard meta and the in-progress marker) are read
only from comments by a repo-associated author (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR), from
one comment fetch, so a fork PR author cannot forge review state. Every reconcile
reads GitHub afresh and drives the sink to the correct state, so the same command
powers the event-driven workflows and a one-shot backfill, and a transient hiccup
self-heals on the next event. The only dependencies are python3's standard library
and an authenticated `gh` CLI, nothing from PyPI.

## Labels

The five labels are mutually exclusive; [`labels.py`](labels.py) sets one and
removes any other, so exactly one is present on an open PR (none on a terminal
PR). All five are provisioned on first use, and **`labels.py` is the sole writer
of them**: the "exactly one" invariant is CI's alone to keep, and it assumes
nothing about any worker or review harness. That is deliberate: anyone can point
their own review harness at TauCeti, and CI must not depend on a particular one.

`review-in-progress` is derived, like the other four, from a signal CI reads
rather than from anyone writing the label. The signal is the review engine's
in-flight marker (`<!--tauceti-review-in-progress-->`, carrying a `head` and an
`expires_at`), treated as an **optional, documented** contract that any review
harness MAY post: an unexpired, head-exact marker while the PR is otherwise
`awaiting-review` shows `review-in-progress`. A harness that posts no marker just
leaves the PR at `awaiting-review` during review, which is never wrong; and the
marker's TTL means a crashed review self-heals, since the hourly `sweep` job
clears the label once the marker expires even if no other event fires.

The review verdict itself comes from the scoreboard's durable per-rubric `states`
map, not the latest round's `runs`: a reply/partial round re-runs only some
rubrics, so `runs` alone can show a green latest round while another rubric still
blocks. This mirrors the worker's `ledger_blocking` and the signal CI's merge
close reads (see [`core.review_state`](core.py)), and falls back to `runs` only
for a legacy scoreboard without a `states` map.

[`pr-labels.yml`](../../.github/workflows/pr-labels.yml) drives it. A first
`resolve` job resolves the PR number once; the `label` job then keys its
`concurrency` on that number, so every trigger for one PR shares a group and two
events can never interleave a label add/remove. It runs under a GitHub App token
scoped to this repo, and, like the roadmap and Zulip workflows, never checks out
or runs PR head code. Triggers:

- `pull_request_target` (opened/reopened/synchronize/closed): new commit or the
  terminal strip.
- `workflow_run` of `pr-build` (completed): the build verdict. (Not `requested`:
  a late `requested` for an old head could force `awaiting-CI` onto a moved PR,
  and a new commit already paints `awaiting-CI` via `synchronize`.)
- `issue_comment` carrying the scoreboard or in-progress marker.
- `schedule` (hourly): the `sweep` backstop that clears an expired
  `review-in-progress`.
- `workflow_dispatch`: manual re-sync of one PR.

## Zulip reactions

[`zulip.py`](zulip.py) finds-or-creates the PR's message in the **PRs** topic and
reconciles two independent, mutually-exclusive reaction groups from `core.derive`:

| Group | State | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CI (build)** | waiting / running | 🟡 `yellow` |
| | passed | 🟢 `green_circle` |
| | failed | 🔴 `red_circle` |
| **Review / lifecycle** | review in progress | 👀 `eyes` |
| | waiting for review | *(none)* |
| | changes requested / blocked | ✍️ `writing` |
| | all review done, all green | ✔️ `check` |
| | merged | `:merge:` |
| | closed, not merged | `:closed-pr:` |

Each message includes the PR's author and the area from every `roadmap/...`
label (with `unlabelled` distinct from the deliberate `roadmap/none`). A later
label change edits the existing message in place, so a roadmap label added after
the PR opens is still shown. The message is found-or-created from the PR's
metadata *before* the fallible CI and review reads, so a transient GitHub hiccup
can never leave a PR without its durable Zulip message. Only the bot's *own*
reactions are authoritative (presence is judged by the bot's user id), so a
human reacting on a status message never confuses reconciliation.

Three event-driven workflows drive it:

- [`zulip-pr.yml`](../../.github/workflows/zulip-pr.yml): on PR
  `opened`/`reopened`/`closed` and label changes. Creates the message, keeps its
  roadmap metadata current, and owns the merged/closed ending. The automatic
  status-label transitions also make review reactions refresh promptly; on an
  open PR they can self-heal a message missed by a transient opening failure,
  while label churn on a closed PR can never create a late post.
- [`zulip-pr-status.yml`](../../.github/workflows/zulip-pr-status.yml): on
  `workflow_run` of `pr-build` and `Review`. Refreshes the CI and review groups.
- [`zulip-healthcheck.yml`](../../.github/workflows/zulip-healthcheck.yml): a
  schedule (every 6h) that runs `check` to probe the credentials, so a broken
  key is caught even during quiet periods with no PR activity.

## Measuring merge conflicts

GitHub reports only the *current* value of a PR's `mergeable`, and its timeline
records nothing when a PR starts conflicting. So "how long do conflicts last here"
is not a question you can look up — there is no log to read.

[`conflict_stats.py`](conflict_stats.py) reconstructs it. A PR conflicts because
main moved and stops because someone pushed, and answering "how long, and who
fixed it" needs three things git cannot give you: which shas were ever the PR's
head, when GitHub received them, and who pushed them. A commit is not a head
(several travel in one push), its committer date is when it was *written*, and its
committer field is free text rather than an account.

All three come from the **push ledger**: `pr-build` runs on `pull_request_target`
for every open, reopen, and synchronize, so one run exists per head *transition* —
the head the PR was opened with, and every head pushed over it — carrying the sha,
the account behind it, and the time GitHub received it. Not every run is a push:
the opening run's sha reached the branch earlier and unrecorded, since a push to a
fork's branch triggers nothing here. It still dates the head, which is what the
replay needs from it. `main`'s first-parent history supplies the bases, from
git. For each head the tool
binary-searches those bases with `git merge-tree` — starting from the base already
in effect, so a PR born conflicting is not missed — for the first that will not
merge cleanly. An episode ends at a head that is *clean* when it appeared, so
successive conflicting heads stay one conflict; a PR closed or merged while still
conflicting is censored rather than counted as a fast resolution.

An episode also ends with nobody pushing, if main moves to a commit the *unchanged*
head merges cleanly with. That is the outcome `main-cleared`, and it is searched
for on every run: while a conflict is open, each later base in the epoch is tried
in turn, so where an episode ends never rests on the monotonicity the onset search
assumes. It has never happened here — the same scan run over every epoch rather
than only the conflicting ones is 41,790 merges over 9,647 epochs, 184 of them
conflicting, and no epoch has a clean base after a conflicting one — but that is a
fact about this history, not a theorem about the next one.

Closing a PR and reopening it does not end an episode — nothing there resolves the
conflict — but the time it spent closed is discounted from the duration, since
nobody could have merged it then, and `closed_seconds` on each row records how
much. That has to come from the timeline: GitHub *clears* `closedAt` on reopen, so
the list read cannot tell a reopened PR from one that never closed. Of the 33 PRs
reopened here, all but one are now closed or merged, and most of the closures are
the review bot pulsing a PR shut and open again a second later.

```bash
python3 scripts/pr_status/conflict_stats.py --ledger-cache /tmp/ledger.json --json episodes.json
python3 scripts/pr_status/conflict_stats.py --exhaustive   # no monotonicity assumption
```

The ledger costs ~100 API reads (the runs listing caps at 1000 per query whatever
`total_count` says, so it is fetched in date slices that halve on hitting the cap);
`--ledger-cache` memoises it. That file is a snapshot rather than the ledger, so it
records the span it covers and a later run reads the time since and merges it in —
read back whole, a cache from this morning would report a conflict fixed at lunch
as still open. A force-pushed head is recorded there but unreachable
from `refs/pull/N/head`, so the replay fetches those objects by sha — 1282 of 9477
here, and ignoring them cost 36 episodes and over half the author-returns.

Provenance is reported per PR and has four values: `recorded` (every recorded push
replayable), `partial` (some heads unfetchable, or a hole in the ledger over that
PR's lifetime, so episodes may be truncated), `inferred` (no ledger coverage —
heads from commit dates, actors unknown), and `skipped`. A PR whose recorded heads
are *all* unfetchable is `partial`, not `inferred`: it falls back to commit dates
like an uncovered PR, but the ledger did cover it, and only `partial` says the
record was lost rather than never taken. A slice of the runs
listing that fails or still caps at its smallest span returns fewer pushes and
looks exactly like a quiet week, so those spans are carried alongside the ledger
and every PR alive during one is downgraded to `partial`; a cache file that does
not record them is rejected rather than read as hole-free. The same rule covers
the timeline read: a failure gives `closed_seconds: null` rather than a zero
discount, and the report counts those rows as upper bounds.

Resolutions are bucketed as the author continuing, the author returning,
*someone else entirely*, or unattributed, and each episode records the measured
gap, so checking that a conclusion is not an artefact of one `--session-gap` costs
a re-read of the JSON rather than a re-run. The gap runs back to that same actor's
previous appearance on the PR, which for one fixed shortly after it opened is them
*opening* it rather than an earlier push. That is still the author present at that
moment, so it counts — dropping it would leave no earlier event and file an author
who never left under `return` — and `gap_from` records which it was, per row and
as a count in the report.

An earlier draft of this file claimed every error ran one way and the output was a
lower bound. That was wrong and is worth stating so nobody revives it: on the
inferred path an intermediate conflicting commit invents an episode, an error in
the other direction. Quote the ledger-covered numbers, treat a run with a large
inferred population as softer, and note that the unresolved tail needs no
reconstruction at all — it matches GitHub's live `CONFLICTING` list.

## Stuck-automation alerts (Tau Ceti > "Stuck PRs")

[`stuck_alerts.py`](stuck_alerts.py), driven by
[`stuck-alerts.yml`](../../.github/workflows/stuck-alerts.yml) hourly, posts to a
second topic (**Stuck PRs**) whenever Tau Ceti's own automation wedges and cannot
recover on its own. It reuses `core`'s GitHub-truth helpers and `zulip`'s Zulip
client (pointed at the topic via `ZULIP_TOPIC`) and is idempotent the same way:
one bot message per active alert, tagged with a hidden `<!--stuck:v1 <key>-->`
marker, edited to a ✅ checkmark when the situation clears and never re-posted
while it persists.

This is an **emergency channel, not a help queue.** Every alert means a piece of
infrastructure needs fixing so the wedge cannot recur, not that a human should
hand-hold one PR. It fires on: a red, stale last-known-good bump PR; a mathlib pin
that has stopped advancing; an in-scope, fully-green PR the merge path never
merged; an open `Review stuck: PR #…` issue; a scheduled workflow that is disabled
or overdue; `main` gone red; and a long-open mathlib-incompatibility issue. It
**deliberately does not** alert on normal backlog (a PR awaiting its first review
verdict, changes-requested nobody addressed, open roadmap issues); the module
docstring lists the full catalogue and the reasoning.

Run `python3 scripts/pr_status/stuck_alerts.py --dry-run` (with `gh` authenticated)
to print the alerts it would post without touching Zulip. Its run goes red only on
a persistent Zulip config break, exactly like the healthcheck.

## One-time setup

1. **Create a dedicated Zulip bot** (Zulip → Settings → Bots → Add a new bot,
   type *Generic*). Subscribe it to the **Tau Ceti** channel: a bot can only
   post and react in channels it belongs to.
2. **Add repository secrets** on `TauCetiProject/TauCeti`:
   - `ZULIP_API_KEY`: the bot's API key
   - `ZULIP_EMAIL`: the bot's email (e.g. `tauceti-pr-bot@leanprover.zulipchat.com`)

   The site is hard-coded to `https://leanprover.zulipchat.com` in the workflows.

   > **Set the key without a trailing newline.** A newline (or stray
   > whitespace) rides into the Basic-auth header and Zulip rejects the key as
   > `Malformed API key` (a 401). Use `--body`, which does not append one:
   >
   > ```bash
   > gh secret set ZULIP_API_KEY --repo TauCetiProject/TauCeti --body "$KEY"
   > ```
   >
   > Avoid `echo "$KEY" | gh secret set ...` (echo adds a newline). The script
   > also `.strip()`s both creds defensively, but set them cleanly anyway.

The labels need no secret: `pr-labels.yml` uses the same GitHub App
(`APP_ID` / `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`) already configured for the roadmap and merge
workflows, scoped to this repo, and provisions the five labels on first use.

## Failure modes (Zulip)

The Zulip integration is quiet about cosmetic problems and loud about real ones,
because the two are easy to confuse from the outside:

- A **transient** hiccup (one Zulip 5xx, a network blip, a PR with no message
  yet) is cosmetic and self-heals on the next reconcile. The script logs it and
  exits 0, so the workflow run stays green.
- A **configuration** break (missing/empty creds, a bad API key (401), a
  forbidden bot (403), or the bot not subscribed to the channel) breaks *every*
  PR and will not fix itself. The script logs it, emits a GitHub Actions
  `::error::` annotation, and exits non-zero, so the workflow run goes **red**.

When a run is red, re-set `ZULIP_API_KEY` per the gotcha above, then confirm:

```bash
export ZULIP_API_KEY=... ZULIP_EMAIL=... ZULIP_SITE=https://leanprover.zulipchat.com
python3 scripts/pr_status/zulip.py check   # exits 0 and prints OK when healthy
```

## Backfill (run locally)

To seed labels and/or Zulip messages for PRs that predate this integration, run
the reconcilers over the open PRs with `gh` authenticated:

```bash
# Labels: needs only an authenticated gh with issues:write.
for pr in $(gh pr list --repo TauCetiProject/TauCeti --state open --json number --jq '.[].number'); do
  python3 scripts/pr_status/labels.py reconcile "$pr"
done

# Zulip: needs the status bot credentials exported. This paginates the complete
# PR history in one low-request stream and edits existing posts in place,
# including posts whose URL predates the FormalFrontier -> TauCetiProject transfer.
export ZULIP_API_KEY=... ZULIP_EMAIL=... ZULIP_SITE=https://leanprover.zulipchat.com
gh api --paginate \
  'repos/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/pulls?state=all&sort=created&direction=asc&per_page=100' \
  --jq '.[] | {
    number,
    state,
    merged: (.merged_at != null),
    head: .head.sha,
    title,
    author: .user.login,
    roadmaps: [.labels[].name | select(startswith("roadmap/"))]
  }' | python3 scripts/pr_status/zulip.py backfill --dry-run --strict

# After reviewing the dry-run summary, omit --dry-run to apply it.
```

Re-running either is safe: it converges to current GitHub state and changes
nothing else. The `Zulip PR backfill` workflow runs the same full-history post
update with the repository's status-bot secrets, so old posts can be migrated
without copying credentials locally. It defaults to a dry run, continues past
individual failures and reports them together, retries transient Zulip failures,
and intentionally does not create missing messages. `pr-labels.yml` also has a
`workflow_dispatch` that reconciles a single PR's label from the Actions tab.

## Unit tests

```bash
cd scripts/pr_status
python3 -m unittest test_pr_labels test_zulip test_stuck_alerts
```

`test_pr_labels` covers the derivation (`core.review_state`, `core.inprogress_from`,
`core.derive`), metadata plumbing, the label collapse (`labels.derived_label`),
and reconcile convergence. `test_zulip` covers review reactions, PR post
rendering, legacy-message rewriting, batch continuation, dry runs, and rate-limit
retry. All GitHub and Zulip reads and writes are stubbed, so these need no
network.
