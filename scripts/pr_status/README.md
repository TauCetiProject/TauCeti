# PR status mirroring

Surface where every TauCeti PR sits in the pipeline, in two places, from one
source of truth:

- **GitHub labels**: exactly one status label on each open PR, visible in the PR
  list and searchable.
- **Zulip reactions**: one bot-owned message per PR in the **Tau Ceti** channel,
  carrying emoji that track the same states at a glance.

[`core.py`](core.py) is that source of truth. It derives a PR's status from
GitHub (PR state, the `build` commit status, the newest
`<!--tauceti-scoreboard-->` comment's meta JSON, and the review engine's
`<!--tauceti-review-in-progress-->` marker) and returns a neutral
`{lifecycle, ci, review, review_inprogress}`. It writes nothing. The two *sinks*
import it and only differ in how they render that one status, so labels and
reactions can never disagree:

| `core.derive` | `labels.py` (one label) | `zulip.py` (two reaction groups) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lifecycle `merged` / `closed` | *(no label)* | `:merge:` / `:closed-pr:` |
| ci `running` | `awaiting-CI` | 🟡 `yellow` |
| ci not reported | `awaiting-CI` | 🟡 `yellow` |
| ci `failure` | `ci-failed` | 🔴 `red_circle` |
| ci `success`, review `changes` | `awaiting-author` | 🟢 + ✍️ `writing` |
| ci `success`, review `approved` | `ready-to-merge` | 🟢 + ✔️ `check` |
| ci `success`, review pending, live marker | `review-in-progress` | 🟢 + 👀 |
| ci `success`, review pending, no marker | `awaiting-review` | 🟢 |

Both review signals (the scoreboard meta and the in-progress marker) are read
from all comments in one fetch. The newest marked scoreboard counts regardless
of author association, matching the worker and auto-merge: a contributor-posted
review therefore moves the PR out of `awaiting-review` everywhere at once. Status
labels and reactions are presentation, not a security boundary; trusted commit
statuses still enforce build, scope, axiom and bump guards. Destructive
housekeeping separately calls `core.repo_associated_scoreboard_meta`, retaining
its OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR-only close policy. Every reconcile reads GitHub
afresh and drives the sink to the correct state, so the same command powers the
event-driven workflows and a one-shot backfill, and a transient hiccup self-heals
on the next event. The only dependencies are python3's standard library and an
authenticated `gh` CLI, nothing from PyPI.

## Labels

The six labels are mutually exclusive; [`labels.py`](labels.py) sets one and
removes any other, so exactly one is present on an open PR (none on a terminal
PR). All six are provisioned on first use, and **`labels.py` is the sole writer
of them**: the "exactly one" invariant is CI's alone to keep, and it assumes
nothing about any worker or review harness. That is deliberate: anyone can point
their own review harness at TauCeti, and CI must not depend on a particular one.

`review-in-progress` is derived, like the other five, from a signal CI reads
rather than from anyone writing the label. The signal is the review engine's
in-flight marker (`<!--tauceti-review-in-progress-->`, carrying a `head` and an
`expires_at`), treated as an **optional, documented** contract that any review
harness MAY post: an unexpired, head-exact marker while the PR is otherwise
`awaiting-review` shows `review-in-progress`. A harness that posts no marker just
leaves the PR at `awaiting-review` during review, which is never wrong; and the
marker's TTL means a crashed review self-heals. The hourly `sweep` reconciles
both review-waiting labels, clearing an expired marker even if no other event
fires and repairing a missed or newly reinterpreted scoreboard event.

The review verdict itself comes from the scoreboard's durable per-rubric `states`
map, not the latest round's `runs`: a reply/partial round re-runs only some
rubrics, so `runs` alone can show a green latest round while another rubric still
blocks. This mirrors the worker's `ledger_blocking` and the per-rubric state map
auto-merge reads (see [`core.review_state`](core.py)), and falls back to `runs`
only for a legacy scoreboard without a `states` map.

[`pr-labels.yml`](../../.github/workflows/pr-labels.yml) drives it. A first
`resolve` job resolves the PR number once; the `label` job then keys its
`concurrency` on that number, so every trigger for one PR shares a group and two
events can never interleave a label add/remove. It runs under a GitHub App token
scoped to this repo, and, like the roadmap and Zulip workflows, never checks out
or runs PR head code. Triggers:

- `pull_request_target` (opened/reopened/synchronize/closed): new commit or the
  terminal strip.
- `workflow_run` of `pr-build` (completed): the build verdict. (Not `requested`:
  a late `requested` for an old head could force `awaiting-CI` onto a moved PR,
  and a new commit already paints `awaiting-CI` via `synchronize`.)
- `issue_comment` carrying the scoreboard or in-progress marker.
- `schedule` (hourly): the `sweep` backstop for `awaiting-review` and
  `review-in-progress`, including policy migrations and expired markers.
- `workflow_dispatch`: manual re-sync of one PR.

## Zulip reactions

[`zulip.py`](zulip.py) finds-or-creates the PR's message in the **PRs** topic and
reconciles two independent, mutually-exclusive reaction groups from `core.derive`:

| Group | State | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CI (build)** | waiting / running | 🟡 `yellow` |
| | passed | 🟢 `green_circle` |
| | failed | 🔴 `red_circle` |
| **Review / lifecycle** | review in progress | 👀 `eyes` |
| | waiting for review | *(none)* |
| | changes requested / blocked | ✍️ `writing` |
| | all review done, all green | ✔️ `check` |
| | merged | `:merge:` |
| | closed, not merged | `:closed-pr:` |

Each message includes the PR's author and the area from every `roadmap/...`
label (with `unlabelled` distinct from the deliberate `roadmap/none`). A later
label change edits the existing message in place, so a roadmap label added after
the PR opens is still shown. The message is found-or-created from the PR's
metadata *before* the fallible CI and review reads, so a transient GitHub hiccup
can never leave a PR without its durable Zulip message. Only the bot's *own*
reactions are authoritative (presence is judged by the bot's user id), so a
human reacting on a status message never confuses reconciliation.

Three event-driven workflows drive it:

- [`zulip-pr.yml`](../../.github/workflows/zulip-pr.yml): on PR
  `opened`/`reopened`/`closed` and label changes. Creates the message, keeps its
  roadmap metadata current, and owns the merged/closed ending. The automatic
  status-label transitions also make review reactions refresh promptly; on an
  open PR they can self-heal a message missed by a transient opening failure,
  while label churn on a closed PR can never create a late post.
- [`zulip-pr-status.yml`](../../.github/workflows/zulip-pr-status.yml): on
  `workflow_run` of `pr-build` and `Review`. Refreshes the CI and review groups.
- [`zulip-healthcheck.yml`](../../.github/workflows/zulip-healthcheck.yml): a
  schedule (every 6h) that runs `check` to probe the credentials, so a broken
  key is caught even during quiet periods with no PR activity.

## Merge conflicts

A PR becomes conflicted because **its base moved**, not because its author did
anything, which makes it the one transition nothing else here can see. Every other
trigger is scoped to the PR (`pull_request_target`, a `pr-build` / `Review`
`workflow_run`, an `issue_comment`), and the base moving fires none of them.
Before [`merge-conflicts.yml`](../../.github/workflows/merge-conflicts.yml) a PR
could pick up a conflict and *nothing anywhere said so* — no label, no comment, no
alert. `stuck_alerts.py` deliberately skips a conflicting PR (it is not being
wrongly withheld by the merge path) and `housekeeping.py` only retires PRs that
are blocking under review, so a conflicted-but-approved PR was reaped by nothing
either. It rotted silently.

[`conflicts.py`](conflicts.py) runs every fifteen minutes: one GraphQL query reads
the whole open queue, `merge-conflict` goes on a PR that has stopped merging and
comes off when it merges again, and the author is told once per episode. The label
is provisioned on first use, like the status labels.

Two properties are why this is a couple of hundred lines rather than a package.

**The label is orthogonal to the status labels.** It is deliberately *not* part of
the mutually-exclusive set [`labels.py`](labels.py) maintains, and nothing else
reads or writes it. A PR can be awaiting review *and* conflicting, and saying both
is more useful than having one hide the other; keeping them separate also means
conflict state never enters `core.derive`, never has to win a precedence argument
against CI or review state, and cannot interfere with what a review harness reads.

**The label is also the state.** Whether an episode is open is just "is the label
on the PR", so there is no marker to parse and no way to fail to recognise our own
bookkeeping — a wrong label self-heals on the next run. It also makes the problem
measurable without writing anything extra, since GitHub timestamps label changes:

```bash
gh api --paginate "/repos/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/issues/N/timeline?per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[] | select(.label.name == "merge-conflict") | "\(.event) \(.created_at) \(.actor.login)"'
```

Read those as **observed label intervals**, not exact conflict durations: the
boundaries are quantised by the fifteen-minute poll and by GitHub's scheduling, a
conflict that arises and clears between two runs is never seen at all, and a PR
closed while labelled has no closing event. The actor distinguishes the bot's own
transitions from a human's.

Two ordering decisions carry the weight:

- **The comment is posted before the label.** The label is what suppresses a
  repeat, so writing it first would mean a comment that then failed was never
  retried — the notice lost silently, which is the one failure this must not have.
  This way the risk is a duplicate comment instead, which is merely annoying.
- **UNKNOWN is skipped per PR, never per run.** GitHub computes `mergeable`
  lazily, so a read just after the base moved answers UNKNOWN and only schedules
  the merge. Those are re-read a few times; whatever stays unknown is left exactly
  as it is, neither labelled nor cleared, while every PR whose state we do know is
  still processed. This is why we do not use
  [`eps1lon/actions-label-merge-conflict`](https://github.com/eps1lon/actions-label-merge-conflict),
  which mathlib4 uses for the same job: on UNKNOWN it returns from the middle of
  its loop, and once its retries are spent returns an empty result, abandoning
  that page of PRs and every later one. A PR whose head has diverged from its
  branch tip sits at `mergeable: null` indefinitely — precisely what
  `stuck_alerts.py`'s `diverged-head` detector exists to catch — so one such PR
  could stop every other conflict being labelled.

A PR carrying a hold label (`keep`/`hold`/`wip`/`human`/`do-not-close`/`blocked`,
matching `stuck_alerts.py`) is left entirely alone rather than labelled-but-silent:
the label means "the author has been told", so labelling without commenting would
leave the conflict silent for good once the hold came off. Only open PRs are read,
so a PR closed while labelled keeps the label — accurate, but it means that
episode has no closing event in the timeline.

Note that labelling and commenting both bump the PR's `updatedAt`, which
`housekeeping.py` treats as freshness — so a conflict episode resets that PR's
seven-day stale-close clock. That is the intended trade: a PR that just learned it
conflicts should get its week to act on it.

## Stuck-automation alerts (Tau Ceti > "Stuck PRs")

[`stuck_alerts.py`](stuck_alerts.py), driven by
[`stuck-alerts.yml`](../../.github/workflows/stuck-alerts.yml) hourly, posts to a
second topic (**Stuck PRs**) whenever Tau Ceti's own automation wedges and cannot
recover on its own. It reuses `core`'s GitHub-truth helpers and `zulip`'s Zulip
client (pointed at the topic via `ZULIP_TOPIC`) and is idempotent the same way:
one bot message per active alert, tagged with a hidden `<!--stuck:v1 <key>-->`
marker, edited to a ✅ checkmark when the situation clears and never re-posted
while it persists.

This is an **emergency channel, not a help queue.** Every alert means a piece of
infrastructure needs fixing so the wedge cannot recur, not that a human should
hand-hold one PR. It fires on: a red, stale last-known-good bump PR; a mathlib pin
that has stopped advancing; an in-scope, fully-green PR the merge path never
merged; an open `Review stuck: PR #…` issue; a scheduled workflow that is disabled
or overdue; `main` gone red; and a long-open mathlib-incompatibility issue. It
**deliberately does not** alert on normal backlog (a PR awaiting its first review
verdict, changes-requested nobody addressed, open roadmap issues); the module
docstring lists the full catalogue and the reasoning.

Run `python3 scripts/pr_status/stuck_alerts.py --dry-run` (with `gh` authenticated)
to print the alerts it would post without touching Zulip. Its run goes red only on
a persistent Zulip config break, exactly like the healthcheck.

## One-time setup

1. **Create a dedicated Zulip bot** (Zulip → Settings → Bots → Add a new bot,
   type *Generic*). Subscribe it to the **Tau Ceti** channel: a bot can only
   post and react in channels it belongs to.
2. **Add repository secrets** on `TauCetiProject/TauCeti`:
   - `ZULIP_API_KEY`: the bot's API key
   - `ZULIP_EMAIL`: the bot's email (e.g. `tauceti-pr-bot@leanprover.zulipchat.com`)

   The site is hard-coded to `https://leanprover.zulipchat.com` in the workflows.

   > **Set the key without a trailing newline.** A newline (or stray
   > whitespace) rides into the Basic-auth header and Zulip rejects the key as
   > `Malformed API key` (a 401). Use `--body`, which does not append one:
   >
   > ```bash
   > gh secret set ZULIP_API_KEY --repo TauCetiProject/TauCeti --body "$KEY"
   > ```
   >
   > Avoid `echo "$KEY" | gh secret set ...` (echo adds a newline). The script
   > also `.strip()`s both creds defensively, but set them cleanly anyway.

The labels need no secret: `pr-labels.yml` uses the same GitHub App
(`APP_ID` / `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`) already configured for the roadmap and merge
workflows, scoped to this repo, and provisions the six labels on first use.

## Failure modes (Zulip)

The Zulip integration is quiet about cosmetic problems and loud about real ones,
because the two are easy to confuse from the outside:

- A **transient** hiccup (one Zulip 5xx, a network blip, a PR with no message
  yet) is cosmetic and self-heals on the next reconcile. The script logs it and
  exits 0, so the workflow run stays green.
- A **configuration** break (missing/empty creds, a bad API key (401), a
  forbidden bot (403), or the bot not subscribed to the channel) breaks *every*
  PR and will not fix itself. The script logs it, emits a GitHub Actions
  `::error::` annotation, and exits non-zero, so the workflow run goes **red**.

When a run is red, re-set `ZULIP_API_KEY` per the gotcha above, then confirm:

```bash
export ZULIP_API_KEY=... ZULIP_EMAIL=... ZULIP_SITE=https://leanprover.zulipchat.com
python3 scripts/pr_status/zulip.py check   # exits 0 and prints OK when healthy
```

## Backfill (run locally)

To seed labels and/or Zulip messages for PRs that predate this integration, run
the reconcilers over the open PRs with `gh` authenticated:

```bash
# Labels: needs only an authenticated gh with issues:write.
for pr in $(gh pr list --repo TauCetiProject/TauCeti --state open --json number --jq '.[].number'); do
  python3 scripts/pr_status/labels.py reconcile "$pr"
done

# Zulip: needs the status bot credentials exported. This paginates the complete
# PR history in one low-request stream and edits existing posts in place,
# including posts whose URL predates the FormalFrontier -> TauCetiProject transfer.
export ZULIP_API_KEY=... ZULIP_EMAIL=... ZULIP_SITE=https://leanprover.zulipchat.com
gh api --paginate \
  'repos/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/pulls?state=all&sort=created&direction=asc&per_page=100' \
  --jq '.[] | {
    number,
    state,
    merged: (.merged_at != null),
    head: .head.sha,
    title,
    author: .user.login,
    roadmaps: [.labels[].name | select(startswith("roadmap/"))]
  }' | python3 scripts/pr_status/zulip.py backfill --dry-run --strict

# After reviewing the dry-run summary, omit --dry-run to apply it.
```

Re-running either is safe: it converges to current GitHub state and changes
nothing else. The `Zulip PR backfill` workflow runs the same full-history post
update with the repository's status-bot secrets, so old posts can be migrated
without copying credentials locally. It defaults to a dry run, continues past
individual failures and reports them together, retries transient Zulip failures,
and intentionally does not create missing messages. `pr-labels.yml` also has a
`workflow_dispatch` that reconciles a single PR's label from the Actions tab.

## Unit tests

```bash
cd scripts/pr_status
python3 -m unittest test_pr_labels test_zulip test_stuck_alerts
```

`test_pr_labels` covers the derivation (`core.review_state`, `core.inprogress_from`,
`core.derive`), metadata plumbing, the label collapse (`labels.derived_label`),
and reconcile convergence. `test_zulip` covers review reactions, PR post
rendering, legacy-message rewriting, batch continuation, dry runs, and rate-limit
retry. All GitHub and Zulip reads and writes are stubbed, so these need no
network.
