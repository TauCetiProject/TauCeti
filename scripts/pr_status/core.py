"""Shared derivation of a TauCeti PR's status from GitHub truth.

This is the single place that reads what a PR's status *is* -- its lifecycle
(open / merged / closed), its `build` CI state, and its review state (from the
canonical `<!--tauceti-scoreboard-->` comment's meta JSON), plus whether a review
is in flight right now (from the engine's `<!--tauceti-review-in-progress-->`
marker). Every status *sink* imports it and renders that one truth its own way:

  * zulip.py   -> two independent groups of emoji reactions on the PR's message
  * labels.py  -> exactly one of the five status labels on the PR itself

Keeping the derivation here means the two sinks can never disagree about what a
PR's state is: they read the same `derive()` and only differ in how they show it.

Everything here reads only trusted GitHub data. The two review signals -- the
scoreboard meta and the in-progress marker -- are taken only from comments by a
repo-associated author (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR), so a fork PR author cannot
forge review state. Both are extracted from ONE comment fetch.

The module is a pure library -- importing it has no side effects, writes nothing,
and needs only python3's standard library plus an authenticated `gh` CLI (via
GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN). It reads GitHub; it never touches Zulip or labels.
